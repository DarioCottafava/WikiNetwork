In a circular system resource input and waste emission and energy leakage are minimized by slowing closing and narrowing energy and material loops this can be achieved through long lasting design maintenance repair reuse remanufacturing refurbishing and recycling. This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy which has a take make dispose model of production. Proponents of the circular economy suggest that a sustainable world does not mean a drop in the quality of life for consumers and can be achieved without loss of revenue or extra costs for manufacturers. The argument is that circular business models can be as profitable as linear models allowing us to keep enjoying similar products and services. citation needed Intuitively the circular economy would appear to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. Reducing the resources used and the waste and leakage created conserves resources and helps to reduce environmental pollution. However it is argued by some that these assumptions are simplistic that they disregard the complexity of existing systems and their potential trade offs. For example the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the circular economy. There are cases that might require different or additional strategies like purchasing new more energy efficient equipment. By reviewing the literature a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft could show that there are at least eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy. The circular economy can cover a broad scope findings from the literature show that researchers have focused on different areas such as industrial applications with both product oriented and services practice and policies to better understand the limitations that the CE currently faces strategic management for details of the circular economy and different outcomes such as potential re use applications and waste management. The circular economy includes products infrastructure equipment and services and applies to every industry sector. citation needed It includes technical resources metals minerals fossil resources and biological resources food fibres timber etc . Most schools of thought advocate a shift from fossil fuels to the use of renewable energy and emphasize the role of diversity as a characteristic of resilient and sustainable systems. It includes discussion of the role of money and finance as part of the wider debate and some of its pioneers have called for a revamp of economic performance measurement tools. citation needed One example of a circular economy model is the implementation of renting models in traditional ownership areas e.g. electronics clothes furniture transportation . Through renting the same product to several clients manufacturers can increase revenues per unit thus decreasing the need to produce more to increase revenues. Recycling initiatives are often described as a circular economy and are likely to be the most widespread models. citation needed As early as Kenneth Boulding raised awareness of an open economy with unlimited input resources and output sinks in contrast with a closed economy in which resources and sinks are tied and remain as long as possible a part of the economy. Boulding s essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth is often cited as the first expression of the circular economy although Boulding does not use that phrase. The circular economy is grounded in the study of feedback rich non linear systems particularly living systems. The contemporary understanding of the Circular Economy and its practical applications to economic systems evolved incorporating different features and contributions from a variety of concepts sharing the idea of closed loops. Some of the relevant theoretical influences are cradle to cradle laws of ecology looped and performance economy regenerative design industrial ecology biomimicry and blue economy. The circular economy CE was further modelled by British environmental economists David W. Pearce and R. Kerry Turner in . In Economics of Natural Resources and the Environment they pointed out that a traditional open ended economy was developed with no built in tendency to recycle which was reflected by treating the environment as a waste reservoir. In the early s Tim Jackson began to pull together the scientific basis for this new approach to industrial production in his edited collection Clean Production Strategies including chapters from pre eminent writers in the field such as Walter R Stahel Bill Rees and Bob Costanza. At the time still called preventive environmental management his follow on book Material Concerns Pollution Profit and Quality of Life synthesised these findings into a manifesto for change moving industrial production away from an extractive linear system towards a more circular economy. In their research report to the European Commission The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy Walter Stahel and Genevieve Reday sketched the vision of an economy in loops or circular economy and its impact on job creation economic competitiveness resource savings and waste prevention. The report was published in as the book Jobs for Tomorrow The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy. Considered as one of the first pragmatic and credible sustainability think tanks the main goals of Stahel s institute are to extend the working life of products to make goods last longer to re use existing goods and ultimately to prevent waste. This model emphasizes the importance of selling services rather than products an idea referred to as the functional service economy and sometimes put under the wider notion of performance economy . This model also advocates more localization of economic activity . Promoting a circular economy was identified as national policy in China s th five year plan starting in . The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has more recently outlined the economic opportunity of a circular economy bringing together complementary schools of thought in an attempt to create a coherent framework thus giving the concept a wide exposure and appeal. Most frequently described as a framework for thinking its supporters claim it is a coherent model that has value as part of a response to the end of the era of cheap oil and materials moreover contributing to the transition for a low carbon economy. In line with this a circular economy can contribute to meeting the COP Paris Agreement. The emissions reduction commitments made by countries at the COP Paris Agreement are not sufficient to limit global warming to . C. To reach the . C ambition it is estimated that additional emissions reductions of billion tonnes CO per year need to be achieved by . Circle Economy and Ecofys estimated that circular economy strategies may deliver emissions reductions that could basically bridge the gap by half. Linear take make dispose industrial processes and the lifestyles dependent on them use up finite reserves to create products with a finite lifespan which end up in landfills or in incinerators. The circular approach by contrast takes insights from living systems. It considers that our systems should work like organisms processing nutrients that can be fed back into the cycle whether biological or technical hence the closed loop or regenerative terms usually associated with it. The generic circular economy label can be applied to or claimed by several different schools of thought but all of them gravitate around the same basic principles. One prominent thinker on the topic is Walter R. Stahel an architect economist and a founding father of industrial sustainability. Credited with having coined the expression Cradle to Cradle in contrast with Cradle to Grave illustrating our Resource to Waste way of functioning in the late s Stahel worked on developing a closed loop approach to production processes co founding the Product Life Institute in Geneva. In the UK Steve D. Parker researched waste as a resource in the UK agricultural sector in developing novel closed loop production systems. These systems mimicked and worked with the biological ecosystems they exploited. In January a report was released entitled Towards the Circular Economy Economic and business rationale for an accelerated transition. The report commissioned by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and developed by McKinsey Company was the first of its kind to consider the economic and business opportunity for the transition to a restorative circular model. Using product case studies and economy wide analysis the report details the potential for significant benefits across the EU. It argues that a subset of the EU manufacturing sector could realize net materials cost savings worth up to billion annually towards stimulating economic activity in the areas of product development remanufacturing and refurbishment. Towards the Circular Economy also identified the key building blocks in making the transition to a circular economy namely in skills in circular design and production new business models skills in building cascades and reverse cycles and cross cycle cross sector collaboration. On the other hand implementing a circular economy in the United States has being presented by Ranta et al. who analyzed the institutional drivers and barriers for the circular economy in different regions worldwide by following the framework developed by Scott R. In the article different worldwide environment friendly institutions were selected and two types of manufacturing processes were chosen for the analysis a product oriented and a waste management. Specifically in the U.S. the product oriented company case in the study was Dell a US manufacturing company for computer technology which was the first company to offer free recycling to customers and to launch to the market a computer made from recycling materials from a verified third party source. Moreover the waste management case that includes many stages such as collection disposal recycling in study was Republic Services the second largest waste management company in the US. The approach to measure the drivers and barriers was to first identify indicators for their cases in study and then to categorize these indicators into drivers when the indicator was in favor of the circular economy model or a barrier when it was not. In the World Economic Forum World Resources Institute Philips Ellen MacArthur Foundation United Nations Environment Programme and over other partners launched the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy PACE . PACE follows on the legacy of WEF s CEO led initiative Project MainStream which sought to scale up circular economy innovations. PACE s original intent has three focal areas developing models of blended finance for circular economy projects especially in developing and emerging economies creating policy frameworks to address specific barriers to advancing the circular economy and promoting Public private partnership for these purposes. PACE members include global corporations like IKEA Coca Cola Alphabet Inc. and DSM company along with governmental partners and development institutions from Denmark The Netherlands Finland Rwanda UAE China and beyond. Initiatives currently managed under PACE include the Capital Equipment Coalition with Philips and numerous other partners and the Global Battery Alliance with over partners. In January PACE released a report entitled A New Circular Vision for Electronics Time for a Global Reboot in support of the United Nations E waste Coalition. To provide authoritative guidance to organizations implementing circular economy CE strategies in the British Standards Institution BSI developed and launched the first circular economy standard BS Framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy in organizations. Guide . The circular economy standard BS tries to align the far reaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines at the organizational level. It contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions describes the core CE principles and presents a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations. Little concrete guidance on circular economy monitoring and assessment is given however as there is no consensus yet on a set of central circular economy performance indicators applicable to organizations and individual products. While the initial focus of academic industry and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of re X recycling remanufacturing reuse ... technology it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation. To leverage this technology for the transition towards a Circular Economy various stakeholders have to work together. This shifted attention towards business model innovation as a key leverage for circular technology adaption. Circular business models can be defined as business models that are closing narrowing slowing intensifying and dematerializing loops to minimize the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organizational system. This comprises recycling measures closing efficiency improvements narrowing use phase extensions slowing a more intense use phase intensifying and the substitution of products by service and software solutions dematerialising . As illustrated in the Figure these five approaches to resource loops can also be seen as generic strategies or archetypes of circular business model innovation. Circular business models as the economic model more broadly can have different emphases and various objectives for example extend the life of materials and products where possible over multiple use cycles use a waste food approach to help recover materials and ensure those biological materials returned to earth are benign not toxic retain the embedded energy water and other process inputs in the product and the material for as long as possible Use systems thinking approaches in designing solutions regenerate or at least conserve nature and living systems push for policies taxes and market mechanisms that encourage product stewardship for example polluter pays regulations. A circular economy within the textiles industry refers to the practice of clothes and fibers continually being recycled to re enter the economy as much as possible rather than ending up as waste. A circular textiles economy is in response to the current linear model of the fashion industry in which raw materials are extracted manufactured into commercial goods and then bought used and eventually discarded by consumers Business of Fashion . Fast fashion companies have fueled the high rates of consumption which further magnify the issues of a linear system. The take make dispose model not only leads to an economic value loss of over billion per year but also has numerous negative environmental and societal impacts Business of Fashion . Such environmental effects include tons of clothing ending up in landfills and incineration while the societal effects put human rights at risk. A revolutionary documentary about the world of fashion The True Cost explained that in fast fashion wages unsafe conditions and factory disasters are all excused because of the needed jobs they create for people with no alternatives. This shows that fast fashion is harming the planet in more ways than one by running on a linear system. It is argued that by following a circular economy the textiles industry can be transformed into a sustainable business. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is at the top of the list as it focuses on the benefits of a circular economy. Their report A New Textiles Economy states the four key ambitions needed to establish a circular economy phasing out substances of concern and microfiber release transforming the way clothes are designed sold and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature radically improving recycling by transforming clothing design collection and reprocessing and making effective use of resources and moving to renewable input. While it sounds like a simple task only a handful of designers in the fashion industry have taken charge including Patagonia Eileen Fisher and Stella McCartney. An example of a circular economy within a fashion brand is Eileen Fisher s Tiny Factory in which customers are encouraged to bring their worn clothing to be manufactured and resold. In an interview on The Glossy Podcast Fisher explains A big part of the problem with fashion is overconsumption. We need to make less and sell less you get to use your creativity but you also get to sell more but not create more stuff. The Tiny Factory proves that it is possible to practice a circular economy in the textiles industry. Both China and Europe have taken the lead in pushing a circular economy. The Journal of Industrial Ecology states the Chinese perspective on the circular economy is broad incorporating pollution and other issues alongside waste and resource concerns while Europe s conception of the circular economy has a narrower environmental scope focusing on waste and resources and opportunities for business. These practices are important for citizens to understand and realize the opportunity and benefits of a circular economy in the textiles industry. The textiles industry has a long way to go to reach a sustainable future. A circular economy could be the answer to the social and environmental issues that the current linear fast fashion model has created. A construction sector is one of the world s largest waste generators. The Circular Economy appears as a helpful solution to diminish an environmental impact of the industry. Construction is very important to the economy of the European Union and its state members. It provides million direct jobs and contributes to about of the EU s GDP. The main causes of the construction s environmental impact are found in the consumption of non renewable resources and the generation of contaminant residues both of which are increasing at an accelerating pace. Decision making about the Circular Economy can be performed on the operational connected with particular parts of the production process tactical connected with whole processes and strategic connected with the whole organization levels. It may concern both construction companies as well as construction projects where a construction company is one of the stakeholders . As a good case that fits the idea of Circular Economy in construction sector on the operational level there can be pointed walnut husks that belong to hard light and natural abrasives used for example in cleaning brick surfaces. Abrasive grains are produced from crushed cleaned and selected walnut shells. They are classified as reusable abrasives. A first attempt to measure the success of Circular Economy implementation was done in a construction company. The logistics industry plays an important role in the Dutch economy because the Netherlands is located in a specific area where transit of commodities takes place on a daily basis. The Netherlands is an example of a country from the EU that has increasingly moved towards incorporating a circular economy given the vulnerability of the Dutch economy as well as other EU countries to be highly dependable on raw materials imports from countries such as China which makes the country susceptible to the unpredictable importation costs for such primary goods. Research related to the Dutch industry shows that of the Dutch companies are knowledgeable and interested in a circular economy furthermore this number increases to for companies with more than employees. Some of the areas are chemical industries wholesale trade industry and agriculture forestry and fisheries because they see a potential reduction of costs when reusing recycling and reducing raw materials imports. In addition logistic companies can enable a connection to a circular economy by providing customers incentives to reduce costs through shipment and route optimization as well as offering services such as prepaid shipping labels smart packaging and take back options. Several statistics have indicated that there will be an increase in freight transport worldwide which will affect the environmental impacts of the global warming potential causing a challenge to the logistics industry however the Dutch council for the Environment and Infrastructure Dutch acronym Rli provided a new framework in which it suggests that the logistics industry can provide other ways to add value to the different activities in the Dutch economy such as an exchange of resources either waste or water flows for production from the different industries in addition to change the transit port concept to a transit hub. Moreover the Rli studied the role of the logistics industry for three sectors agriculture and food chemical industries and high tech industries which can be found detailed in Towards a Circular Economy The Role of Dutch Logistics Industries and Governments . The CE does not aim at changing the profit maximization paradigm of businesses. Rather it suggests an alternative way of thinking how to attain a Sustained Competitive Advantage SCA while concurrently addressing the environmental and socio economic concerns of the st century. Indeed stepping away from linear forms of production most often leads to the development of new core competencies along the value chain and ultimately superior performance that cuts costs improves efficiency meets advanced government regulations and the expectations of green consumers. But despite the multiple examples of companies successfully embracing circular solutions across industries and notwithstanding the wealth of opportunities that exist when a firm has clarity over what circular actions fit its unique profile and goals CE decision making remains a highly complex exercise with no one size fits all solution. The intricacy and fuzziness of the topic is still felt by most companies especially SMEs which perceive circular strategies as something not applicable to them or too costly and risky to implement. This concern is today confirmed by the results of ongoing monitoring studies like the Circular Readiness Assessment. Strategic management is the field of management that comes to the rescue allowing companies to carefully evaluate CE inspired ideas but also to take a firm apart and investigate if how where seeds of circularity can be found or implanted. The book Strategic Management and the Circular Economy defined for the first time a CE strategic decision making process covering the phases of analysis formulation and planning. Each phase is supported by frameworks and concepts popular in management consulting like idea tree value chain VRIE Porter s five forces PEST SWOT strategic clock or the internationalization matrix all adapted through a CE lens hence revealing new sets of questions and considerations. Although yet to be verified it is argued that all standard tools for strategic management can and should be calibrated and applied to a CE. A specific argument has already been made for the strategy direction matrix of product vs market and the GE McKinsey matrix to assess business strength vs industry attractiveness the BCG matrix of market share vs industry growth rate and Kraljic s portfolio matrix. On December the European Commission published a document entitled Manifesto for a Resource Efficient Europe . This manifesto clearly stated that In a world with growing pressures on resources and the environment the EU has no choice but to go for the transition to a resource efficient and ultimately regenerative circular economy. Furthermore the document highlighted the importance of a systemic change in the use and recovery of resources in the economy in ensuring future jobs and competitiveness and outlined potential pathways to a circular economy in innovation and investment regulation tackling harmful subsidies increasing opportunities for new business models and setting clear targets. The European environmental research and innovation policy aims at supporting the transition to a circular economy in Europe defining and driving the implementation of a transformative agenda to green the economy and the society as a whole to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon which is also open to participation worldwide. The European Union plans for a circular economy are spearheaded by its Circular Economy Package. Historically the policy debate in Brussels mainly focused on waste management which is the second half of the cycle and very little is said about the first half eco design. To draw the attention of policymakers and other stakeholders to this loophole the Ecothis an EU campaign was launched raising awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco design as part of the circular economy package. The various approaches to circular business and economic models share several common principles with other conceptual frameworks Janine Benyus author of Biomimicry Innovation Inspired by Nature defines Biomimicry as Initiated by former Ecover CEO and Belgian entrepreneur Gunter Pauli derived from the study of natural biological production processes the official manifesto states using the resources available...the waste of one product becomes the input to create a new cash flow . Created by Walter R. Stahel and similar theorists in which industry adopts the reuse and service life extension of goods as a strategy of waste prevention regional job creation and resource efficiency in order to decouple wealth from resource consumption. Industrial Ecology is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems. Focusing on connections between operators within the industrial ecosystem this approach aims at creating closed loop processes in which waste is seen as input thus eliminating the notion of undesirable by product. Resource recovery is using wastes as an input material to create valuable products as new outputs. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated therefore reducing the need for landfill space and also extracting maximum value from waste. The ability to understand how things influence one another within a whole. Elements are considered as fitting in their infrastructure environment and social context. The Biosphere Rules is a framework for implementing closed loop production processes. They derived from nature systems and translated for industrial production systems. The five principles are Materials Parsimony Value Cycling Power Autonomy Sustainable Product Platforms and Function Over Form.",FALSE
"2",2,"sustainability","/wiki/Sustainability",FALSE,0,"null","Sustainability is the ability to exist constantly"," Sustainability is the ability to exist constantly. In the st century refers generally to the ability to exist of the biosphere and human civilisation. Defined also as the process of people maintaining change in a balanced environment in which the exploitation of resources the direction of investments the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations. For many in the field sustainability is defined through the following interconnected domains or pillars environment economic and social which according to Fritjof Capra is based on the principles of Systems Thinking. Sub domains of sustainable development have been considered also cultural technological and political. While sustainable development may be the organizing principle for sustainability for some for others the two terms are paradoxical i.e. development is inherently unsustainable . Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Brundtland Report for the World Commission on Environment and Development introduced the term of sustainable development. Sustainability can also be defined as a socio ecological process characterized by the pursuit of a common ideal. An ideal is by definition unattainable in a given time and space. However by persistently and dynamically approaching it the process results in a sustainable system. The study of ecology believes that sustainability is achieved through the balance of species and the resources within their environment. In order to maintain this equilibrium available resources must not be depleted faster than resources are naturally generated. Modern use of the term sustainability is broad and difficult to define precisely. Originally sustainability meant making only such use of natural renewable resources that people can continue to rely on their yields in the long term. The concept of sustainability or Nachhaltigkeit in German can be traced back to Hans Carl von Carlowitz and was applied to forestry. Healthy ecosystems and environments are necessary to the survival of humans and other organisms. Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally friendly chemical engineering environmental resources management and environmental protection. Information is gained from green computing green chemistry earth science environmental science and conservation biology. Ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems. Moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails international and national law urban planning and transport supply chain management local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions e.g. ecovillages eco municipalities and sustainable cities reappraising economic sectors permaculture green building sustainable agriculture or work practices sustainable architecture using science to develop new technologies green technologies renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources. The term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of human ecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability. Despite the increased popularity of the use of the term sustainability the possibility that human societies will achieve environmental sustainability has been and continues to be questioned in light of environmental degradation climate change overconsumption population growth and societies pursuit of unlimited economic growth in a closed system. The name sustainability is derived from the Latin sustinere tenere to hold sub under . Sustain can mean maintain support or endure . Since the s sustainability has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations on March sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . The World Summit on Social Development identified sustainable development goals such as economic development social development and environmental protection. This view has been expressed as an illustration using three overlapping ellipses indicating that the three pillars of sustainability are not mutually exclusive and can be mutually reinforcing. In fact the three pillars are interdependent and in the long run none can exist without the others. The three pillars have served as a common ground for numerous sustainability standards and certification systems in recent years in particular in the food industry. Standards which today explicitly refer to the triple bottom line include Rainforest Alliance Fairtrade and UTZ Certified. Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability or a quadruple bottom line. One such pillar is future generations which emphasizes the long term thinking associated with sustainability. There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability. Sustainable development consists of balancing local and global efforts to meet basic human needs without destroying or degrading the natural environment. The question then becomes how to represent the relationship between those needs and the environment. A study from pointed out that environmental justice is as important as sustainable development. Ecological economist Herman Daly asked what use is a sawmill without a forest From this perspective the economy is a subsystem of human society which is itself a subsystem of the biosphere and a gain in one sector is a loss from another. This perspective led to the nested circles figure of economics inside society inside the environment . The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco systems though vague conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits. But sustainability is also a call to action a task in progress or journey and therefore a political process so some definitions set out common goals and values. The Earth Charter speaks of a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature universal human rights economic justice and a culture of peace . This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability which included the importance of the domain of politics . More than that sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision making and innovation that minimizes negative impact and maintains balance between ecological resilience economic prosperity political justice and cultural vibrancy to ensure a desirable planet for all species now and in the future. Specific types of sustainability include sustainable agriculture sustainable architecture or ecological economics. Understanding sustainable development is important but without clear targets an unfocused term like liberty or justice . It has also been described as a dialogue of values that challenge the sociology of development . While the United Nations Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains economics environment and social sustainability. More recently using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade the Circles of Sustainability approach distinguished four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability this in accord with the United Nations Unesco Agenda and in particular the Agenda for culture which specifies culture as the fourth domain of sustainable development. The model is now being used by organizations such as the United Nations Cities Programme and Metropolis. In the case of Metropolis this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant triple bottom line figure of the economy environment and the social. Rather it involves treating all four domains economy ecology politics and culture as social including economics and distinguishing between ecology as the intersection of the human and natural worlds and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know. Another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities economy community occupational groups government environment culture and physiology. From the global to the individual human scale each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities. Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme Horizon which is also open to participation worldwide. Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations. Additionally instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process. Resiliency in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability. Resilience thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to policymakers a definition remains elusive. Resilience thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service s current and future generations need from them. It is also concerned with commitment from geopolitical policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life. The resiliency of an ecosystem and thereby its sustainability can be reasonably measured at junctures or events where the combination of naturally occurring regenerative forces solar energy water soil atmosphere vegetation and biomass interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances. A practical view of sustainability is closed systems that maintain processes of productivity indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems. In this way sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature the accounting occurs naturally through a process of adaptation as an ecosystem returns to viability from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi stage process that begins with the disturbance event earthquake volcanic eruption hurricane tornado flood or thunderstorm followed by absorption utilization or deflection of the energy or energies that the external forces created. In analysing systems such as urban and national parks dams farms and gardens theme parks open pit mines water catchments one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events. The history of sustainability traces human dominated ecological systems from the earliest civilizations to the present day. This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular society followed by crises that were either resolved producing sustainability or not leading to decline. In early human history the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities. Between and years ago agrarian communities emerged which depended largely on their environment and the creation of a structure of permanence . The Western industrial revolution of the th to th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid th century a gathering environmental movement pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late th century environmental problems became global in scale. The and energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non renewable energy resources. In the st century there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the human greenhouse effect produced largely by forest clearing and the burning of fossil fuels. The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields in recent years an area that has come to be called sustainability science has emerged. Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales levels or frames of reference of time and space and in many contexts of environmental social and economic organization. The focus ranges from the total carrying capacity sustainability of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors ecosystems countries municipalities neighbourhood home gardens individual lives individual goods and services clarification needed occupations lifestyles behaviour patterns and so on. In short it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it. As Daniel Botkin author and environmentalist has stated We see a landscape that is always in flux changing over many scales of time and space. The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other more tangible closed systems. For example he likens human existence on Earth isolated as the planet is in space whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated depletion of resources to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water. In both cases he argues exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival. A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of biophysical resources and especially the Earth s ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used whether or not those resources are renewable and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales from economic sectors like agriculture manufacturing and industry to work organizations the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services. One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the s and is called the I PAT formula. This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components population numbers levels of consumption which it terms affluence although the usage is different and impact per unit of resource use which is termed technology because this impact depends on the technology used . The equation is expressed In recent years concepts based on re cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts might be the Circular economy with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought including cradle to cradle laws of ecology looped and performance economy regenerative design industrial ecology biomimicry and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade offs. For example the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular economy and there are cases that require different or additional strategies such as purchasing new more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy namely Sustainability measurement is the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability involving the sustainability of environmental social and economic domains both individually and in various combinations are evolving they include indicators benchmarks audits sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic indexes and accounting as well as assessment appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting Triple Bottom Line accounting World Sustainability Society Circles of Sustainability and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the Environmental Sustainability Index and Environmental Performance Index. One of the most known ways to measure environmental sustainability is Planetary boundaries. According to the most recent July revision of the official United Nations World Population Prospects the world population is projected to reach . billion by up from the current . billion July to exceed billion people by and to reach . billion by the year . Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from . billion in to . billion in . This increase will be distributed among the population aged . billion and or over . billion because the number of children under age in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from . billion to . billion and this would have declined to . billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries which is expected to average . million persons annually from to . Long term estimates in of global population suggest a peak at around of nine to ten billion people and then a slow decrease to . billion by . Emerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world as does the non industrialized world in general. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability. At the global scale scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the carrying capacity of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely. This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the planetary boundaries framework. An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the book Limits to Growth which has prompted follow up commentary and analysis. A review in Nature by international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be approaching a state shift in its biosphere. The ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources for and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In it required . global hectares per person more than the natural biological capacity of . global hectares assuming no provision for other organisms . The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways embedded in the goods and services of world trade taken from the past e.g. fossil fuels or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries . The figure right examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN Human Development Index a measure of standard of living . The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while at the same time maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use. The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels that is to not exceed one planet consumption. Information generated by reports at the national regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time. Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu Roegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth that is Earth s capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth s finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and steady state theorist Herman Daly a student of Georgescu Roegen has propounded the same argument. At the enterprise scale carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations. This is most clearly demonstrated through use of Context Based Sustainability CBS tools methods and metrics including the MultiCapital Scorecard which have been in development since . Contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations which tend to be more incrementalist in form CBS is explicitly tied to social environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world. Thus rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another CBS makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organization specific norms standards or thresholds for what they the impacts would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable i.e. which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or non human well being . At a fundamental level energy flow and biogeochemical cycling set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem. Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life most notably those of water oxygen carbon nitrogen and phosphorus. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an international synthesis by over of the world s leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth s ecosystems and provides summaries and guidelines for decision makers. It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world ecosystems reducing both their resilience and biocapacity. The report refers to natural systems as humanity s life support system providing essential ecosystem services . The assessment measures ecosystem services and concludes that only four have shown improvement over the last years are in serious decline and five are in a precarious condition. In a summary for policymakers of the largest most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services was published by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions . Over the last years the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate. . The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use exploitation of living beings climate change pollution and invasive species. These five drivers in turn are caused by societal behaviors from consumption to governance. . Damage to ecosystems undermines of selected UN targets including the UN General Assembly s Sustainable Development Goals for poverty hunger health water cities climate oceans and land. It can cause problems with food water and humanity s air supply. . To fix the problem humanity will need a transformative change including sustainable agriculture reductions in consumption and waste fishing quotas and collaborative water management. In research was published showing that insects are destroyed by human activities like habitat destruction pesticide poisoning invasive species and climate change at a rate that will cause the collapse of ecological systems in the next years if it cannot be stopped. The Sustainable Development Goals SDGs are the United Nations General Assembly s current harmonized set of seventeen future international development targets. The Official Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on September has paragraphs with the main paragraph outlining the Sustainable Development Goals and its associated targets. This included the following seventeen goals As of August there were proposed targets for these goals and proposed indicators to show compliance. The Sustainable Development Goals replace the eight Millennium Development Goals MDGs which expired at the end of . The MDGs were established in following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations. Adopted by the United Nations member states at the time and more than twenty international organizations these goals were advanced to help achieve the following sustainable development standards by . According to the data that member countries represented to the United Nations Cuba was the only country in the world in that met the World Wide Fund for Nature s definition of sustainable development with an ecological footprint of less than . hectares per capita . and a Human Development Index of over . .. Education for sustainable development ESD is commonly understood as education that encourages changes in knowledge skills values and attitudes to enable a more sustainable and just society for all. ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the economic social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. The concept of ESD was born from the need for education to address the growing environmental challenges facing the planet. Education should change to provide the knowledge skills values and attitudes that empower learners to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time it has been argued that education must be strengthened in all agendas programmes and activities that promote sustainable development. It has been suggested Sustainable development is integrated into education and education is integrated into sustainable development. Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and the first of these is environmental management. This direct approach is based largely on information gained from earth science environmental science and conservation biology. However this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human consumption so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use. Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration for non renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment. At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the oceans freshwater systems land and atmosphere but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden. In weeks before the elections to the European Parlament the World Wide Fund for Nature stated that the European Union is unsustainable in his current mode of life and economy and asked him to fix it by Shift to sustainable consumption and food systems make Europe climate neutral by restore our Nature protect the Ocean invest in a sustainable future At a March meeting of the Copenhagen Climate Council climate experts from countries issued a keynote statement that there is now no excuse for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction abrupt or irreversible shifts in climate may occur that will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with . Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities see Energy below . Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance albedo of the Earth s surface. Known as global dimming the decrease is estimated to have been about between and although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming. Reforestation is one of the ways to stop desertification fueled by anthropogenic climate change and non sustainable land use. One of the most important projects is the Great Green Wall that should stop the expansion of Sahara desert to the south. By only of it is accomplished but there are already many positive effects which include Over million acres million hectares of degraded land has been restored in Nigeria roughly million acres of drought resistant trees have been planted across Senegal and a whopping million acres of land has been restored in Ethiopia just to name a few of the states involved. many groundwater wells refilled with drinking water rural towns with additional food supplies and new sources of work and income for villagers thanks to the need for tree maintenance . Water covers of the Earth s surface. Of this . is the salty water of the oceans and only . freshwater most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers lakes rivers wetlands the soil aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as during the th century more than half the world s wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue harvestable and green soil water available for plant use water and this applies at all scales of water management. Ocean circulation patterns have a strong influence on climate and weather and in turn the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility under the influence of climate change of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world s population about million people live in low lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise. Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation agriculture forest woodland grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities. Since the Neolithic Revolution about of the world s forests have been lost to human use. Present day forests occupy about a quarter of the world s ice free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing with the exception of Siberia but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern. Food is essential to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth s resources. This begins with the appropriation of about of the Earth s land surface and about of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource hungry activities of industrial agribusiness everything from the crop need for irrigation water synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging transport now a major part of global trade and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture organic farming and more sustainable business practices. The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns through to the resource demands of specific goods and services the impacts of economic sectors through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use the total resources needed to produce a product or service resource intensity and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food energy materials and water. In the International Resource Panel hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health human health and resource depletion. From a production perspective it found that fossil fuel combustion processes agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile from a final consumption perspective it found that household consumption related to mobility shelter food and energy using products cause the majority of life cycle impacts of consumption. The Sun s energy stored by plants primary producers during photosynthesis passes through the food chain to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels has been a major driver of technology which in turn has been the source of both economic and political power. In climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a probability that atmospheric increase in CO was human induced mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world s climate will require high income countries to reduce their emissions by over levels by which should hold CO levels at ppm from current levels of about ppm. Above this level temperatures could rise by more than C to produce catastrophic climate change. Reduction of current CO levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to energy intensive high consumption Western lifestyles. Reducing greenhouse emissions is being tackled at all scales ranging from tracking the passage of carbon through the carbon cycle to the commercialization of renewable energy developing less carbon hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead carbon neutral lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all the goods and services they use. Engineering of emerging technologies such as carbon neutral fuel and energy storage systems such as power to gas compressed air energy storage and pumped storage hydroelectricity are necessary to store power from transient renewable energy sources including emerging renewables such as airborne wind turbines. Water security and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy especially the increase in irrigated land growth in industrial and power sectors and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes affected their water quality and had a significant impact on the global water cycle. Currently towards of human water use is unsustainable drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe populations increase aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From to water demand doubled agricultural use increased by industrial use by more than and domestic use more than . In the s it was estimated that humans were using of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of for agriculture for industry and for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing. Water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased demand management improved infrastructure improved water productivity of agriculture minimising the water intensity embodied water of goods and services addressing shortages in the non industrialized world concentrating food production in areas of high productivity and planning for climate change such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level people are becoming more self sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of mains water. The American Public Health Association APHA defines a sustainable food system as one that provides healthy food to meet current food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems that can also provide food for generations to come with minimal negative impact to the environment. A sustainable food system also encourages local production and distribution infrastructures and makes nutritious food available accessible and affordable to all. Further it is humane and just protecting farmers and other workers consumers and communities. Industrial agriculture cause environmental impacts health problem associated with obesity in the rich world and hunger in the poor world. This has generated a strong movement towards healthy sustainable eating as a major component of overall ethical consumerism. The environmental effects of different dietary patterns depend on many factors including the proportion of animal and plant foods consumed and the method of food production. The World Health Organization has published a Global Strategy on Diet Physical Activity and Health report which was endorsed by the May World Health Assembly. It recommends the Mediterranean diet which is associated with health and longevity and is low in meat rich in fruits and vegetables low in added sugar and limited salt and low in saturated fatty acids the traditional source of fat in the Mediterranean is olive oil rich in monounsaturated fat. The healthy rice based Japanese diet is also high in carbohydrates and low in fat. Both diets are low in meat and saturated fats and high in legumes and other vegetables they are associated with a low incidence of ailments and low environmental impact. At the global level the environmental impact of agribusiness is being addressed through sustainable agriculture and organic farming. At the local level there are various movements working towards local food production more productive use of urban wastelands and domestic gardens including permaculture urban horticulture local food slow food sustainable gardening and organic gardening. Sustainable seafood is seafood from either fished or farmed sources that can maintain or increase production in the future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods. As global population and affluence has increased so has the use of various materials increased in volume diversity and distance transported. Included here are raw materials minerals synthetic chemicals including hazardous substances manufactured products food living organisms and waste. By humanity could consume an estimated billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current amount unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries citizens consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries with resource consumption levels far beyond what is likely sustainable. Sustainable use of materials has targeted the idea of dematerialization converting the linear path of materials extraction use disposal in landfill to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and the increasing use of material flow analysis at all levels especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non renewables from a life cycle standpoint. Synthetic chemical production has escalated following the stimulus it received during the second World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere chemicals of particular concern include heavy metals nuclear waste chlorofluorocarbons persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless there needs to be rigorous testing of new chemicals in all countries for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handled by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Every economic activity produces material that can be classified as waste. To reduce waste industry business and government are now mimicking nature by turning the waste produced by industrial metabolism into resource. Dematerialization is being encouraged through the ideas of industrial ecology ecodesign and ecolabelling. In addition to the well established reduce reuse and recycle shoppers are using their purchasing power for ethical consumerism. The European Union is expected to table by the end of an ambitious Circular Economy package which is expected to include concrete legislative proposals on waste management ecodesign and limits on land fills. In a new report Plastic and Climate was published. According to the report plastic will contribute greenhouse gases in the equivalent of million tons of carbon dioxide CO to the atmosphere in . In current trend annual emissions will grow to . billion tons by . By plastic could emit billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as much as percent of the earth s remaining carbon budget. On one account sustainability concerns the specification of a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption wealth utility or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons . Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics represents ... a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective. Social cultural health related and monetary financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis. However the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare resources or profit margins. At present the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between on the one hand economic growth and on the other environmental damage and resource depletion. A recent UNEP report proposes a green economy defined as one that improves human well being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities it does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital . The report makes three key findings that greening not only generates increases in wealth in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital but also over a period of six years produces a higher rate of GDP growth that there is an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor in the transition to a green economy new jobs are created which in time exceed the losses in brown economy jobs. However there is a period of job losses in transition which requires investment in re skilling and re educating the workforce . Several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior. Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation as communities grow so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers economic growth and environmental indicators. Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer because it eats away at the Earth s ecosystem services which are its life support system. There is concern that unless resource use is checked modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base. While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale rather than continual growth fair distribution and efficient allocation in that order. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that business cannot succeed in societies that fail . In economic and environmental fields the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how if or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In the International Resource Panel hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP warned that by the human race could be devouring billion tons of minerals ores fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current rate of consumption unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ranging up to or more tons per person in some developed countries . By comparison the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity the amount of resource e.g. water energy or materials needed for the production consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service whether this be achieved from improved economic management product design or new technology. There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity i.e. energy and materials use per unit GDP could in principle be reduced by at least four or five fold thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. On the other hand an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth in large part because of the rebound effect conservation or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. Furthermore there are inherent thermodynamic i.e. second law of thermodynamics and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food and there are limits to making automobiles houses furniture and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution i.e. economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently long term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community. A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the restore approach. This approach views restore as a fourth component to the common reduce reuse recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects. The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality technical innovation and alternative products. However this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons. One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to internalize these externalities by using market strategies like ecotaxes and incentives tradeable permits for carbon and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services. Community currencies associated with Local Exchange Trading Systems LETS a gift economy and Time Banking have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment. Green economics is another market based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment. The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world s carbon dioxide emissions in years. Treating the environment as an externality may generate short term profit at the expense of sustainability. Sustainable business practices on the other hand integrate ecological concerns with social and economic ones i.e. the triple bottom line . Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed uneconomic growth as it leads to a decline in quality of life. Minimizing such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses. For example industrial waste can be treated as an economic resource in the wrong place . The benefits of waste reduction include savings from disposal costs fewer environmental penalties and reduced liability insurance. This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image. Energy efficiency can also increase profits by reducing costs. The idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning the Sustainable Business Institute and the World Council for Sustainable Development. The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green collar workers. Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability and led to emergence of the concept of embedded sustainability defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as incorporation of environmental health and social value into the core business with no trade off in price or quality in other words with no social or green premium . Laszlo and Zhexembayeva s research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation a better risk management b increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use c better product differentiation d new market entrances e enhanced brand and reputation f greater opportunity to influence industry standards and g greater opportunity for radical innovation. Nadya Zhexembayeva s research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services as well as the company strategy as a whole when right principles of innovation are applied. One school of thought often labeled ecosocialism or ecological Marxism asserts that the capitalist economic system is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability. This theory rests on the premises that Thus according to this analysis By this logic market based solutions to ecological crises ecological economics environmental economics green economy are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism s structural failures. Low risk technology science based solutions such as solar power sustainable agriculture and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient. High risk technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to greenwash their practices are regarded as false advertising and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology such as Walmart s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption viz. further economic growth. Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate and capitalist governments to implement constraints on maximum profit such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large scale change History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point at which the system s underlying accumulation drive is affected its resistance to environmental demands stiffens. They also note that up until the event of total ecological collapse destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation thus capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters i.e. convert to sustainable ecological production . Ecosocialists advocate for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism an egalitarian economic political social structure designed to harmonize human society with non human ecology and to fulfill human needs as the only sufficient solution to the present day ecological crisis and hence the only path towards sustainability. Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists environmental activists and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom through social struggle in order to create a whole new world in coevolution with the planet. Sustainability issues are generally expressed in scientific and environmental terms as well as in ethical terms of stewardship but implementing change is a social challenge that entails among other things international and national law urban planning and transport local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. The relationship between human rights and human development corporate power and environmental justice global poverty and citizen action suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice. Social disruptions like war crime and corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future and generally threaten human well being and the environment. Broad based strategies for more sustainable social systems include improved education and the political empowerment of women especially in developing countries greater regard for social justice notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries and intergenerational equity. Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of resource wars . This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as environmental security and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere. For achieve sustainability global peace will probably be needed because economic growth is one of the main factors that determines the military capability. Without peace and international cooperation country that will limit its economic growth achieve lower military capability then a country that will not do it. The result may be a conquest of the first country by the second. In such conditions there is very low probability that a steady state economy can exist. Economic growth will continue what can pose problems to sustainability. A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty. It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future and the Millennium Development Goals. There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues according to the Brundtland report poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality. Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs such as nutrition and medicine and general well being. As population growth continues to increase increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated and the world s poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates. The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy whereas using PET solar water disinfection would be. Also sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country s timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries such as Bridges to Prosperity s use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa. According to Murray Bookchin the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in hierarchical societies. Bookchin contends that capitalism and market relationships if unchecked have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a commodity The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital. Social ecology founded by Bookchin is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity s present ecological problems originate in indeed are mere symptoms of dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems implementing recommendations which stem from physical biological economic etc. studies Bookchin s claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences. A pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change to mitigation the effects of global warming in this excerpt the greatest example of market failure we have ever seen. In regard to the United States of America The Government and the Economy has had a long lasting impact on the environment but in a problematic way. Policy issues regarding the environment has shown that the country regards the protection of the environment as a second hand issue . One causation from this is a certain dilemma called collective action problem or collective action dilemmas. These occur when individuals firms or governments would be better off if they cooperated in the pursuit of a common goal but for one reason or another one or more of those involved choose a less optimal course of action. Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash have made a model establishing cells that are explaining each benefit for the government or the economic process. For the government one cost might be the loss of public confidence and trust while a firm might lose market share and profitability Deep ecology is a movement founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles for the well being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates among other things a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic technological and ideological structures that will improve the quality of life rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species for example through artificial photosynthesis allowing Rights of Nature. . Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels underground metals and minerals . Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals and other unnatural substances . Reduce encroachment upon nature One approach to sustainable living exemplified by small scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages seeks to create self reliant communities based on principles of simple living which maximize self sufficiency particularly in food production. These principles on a broader scale underpin the concept of a bioregional economy. These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology. Other approaches loosely based around New Urbanism are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport and zero emission housing. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. Compact urban neighbourhoods would also promote a great people climate where by increasing the accessibility to bike walk or take public transport within neighbourhoods would increase the amount of interaction between people. With more diversification between people this increases people s happiness and leads to a better standard of living. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the s. The concept of circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl. Large scale social movements can influence both community choices and the built environment. Eco municipalities may be one such movement. Eco municipalities take a systems approach based on sustainability principles. The eco municipality movement is participatory involving community members in a bottom up approach. In Sweden more than cities and towns per cent of all municipalities in the country have adopted a common set of Sustainability Principles and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations. There are now twelve eco municipalities in the United States and the American Planning Association has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles. There is a wealth of advice available to individuals wishing to reduce their personal and social impact on the environment through small inexpensive and easily achievable steps. But the transition required to reduce global human consumption to within sustainable limits involves much larger changes at all levels and contexts of society. The United Nations has recognised the central role of education and have declared a decade of education for sustainable development which aims to challenge us all to adopt new behaviours and practices to secure our future . The Worldwide Fund for Nature proposes a strategy for sustainability that goes beyond education to tackle underlying individualistic and materialistic societal values head on and strengthen people s connections with the natural world. Application of social sustainability requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights prevention of human trafficking and other human rights risks. These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services. The Equator Principles financial industry Fair Wear Foundation garments and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life cycle of products and the producer or vendor level such as Green Seal for cleaning products NSF for carpet production and even labeling of organic food in the United States. The cultural dimension of sustainability is known as cultural sustainability. Important in the advancement of this notion have been the United Nations UNESCO and in particular their Agenda and Agenda for culture now also known as Culture a program for cultural governance developed in and coordinated by United Cities and Local Governments UCLG created in . Sustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism. Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow up visits to the real thing objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism as the maximisation of existential felt authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits. The section describes shortly the main threats to sustainability according to current scientific understanding. In a group of scientist described nine planetary boundaries. Transgressing even one of them can be dangerous to sustainability. Those boundaries are In Jared Diamond published a book titled Collapse How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed in which he described main problems that can be dangerous to sustainability Strategies for reaching sustainability can generally be divided into three categories. Most governments and international organizations that aim to achieve sustainability employ all three approaches though they may disagree on which deserves priority. The three approaches embodied in the I PAT formula can be summarized as follows Affluence Many believe that the best path to sustainability is reducing consumption. This theory is represented most clearly in the idea of a steady state economy meaning an economy without growth. Methods in this category include among others the phase out of lightweight plastic bags promoting biking and increasing energy efficiency. For example in a new report Plastic and Climate was published. According to the report by plastic could emit billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions as much as percent of the earth s remaining carbon budget and has many negative impacts on the ecosystems like phytoplankton that are not fully understood yet. The report says that only solutions which involve a reduction in consumption can solve the problem while others like biodegradable plastic ocean cleanup using renewable energy in plastic industry can do little and in some cases may even worsen it. Population Others think that the most effective means of achieving sustainability is population control for example by improving access to birth control and education. citation needed Technology Still others hold that the most promising path to sustainability is new technology. This theory may be seen as a form of technological optimism. One popular tactic in this category is transitioning to renewable energy. Others methods to achieve sustainability associated with this theory are climate engineering geo engineering genetic engineering GMO Genetically modified organism decoupling. Organizations whose main purpose is to maintain sustainability are generally defined as environmental organizations. They are part of the environmental movement. By sector ",FALSE
"3",3,"recycling","/wiki/Recycling",TRUE,0,"material|material|process|waste|","Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects"," Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to conventional waste disposal that can save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials thereby reducing energy usage air pollution from incineration and water pollution from landfilling . Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the Reduce Reuse and Recycle waste hierarchy. Thus recycling aims at environmental sustainability by substituting raw material inputs into and redirecting waste outputs out of the economic system. There are some ISO standards related to recycling such as ISO for plastics waste and ISO for environmental management control of recycling practice. Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass paper cardboard metal plastic tires textiles batteries and electronics. The composting or other reuse of biodegradable waste such as food or garden waste is also a form of recycling. Materials to be recycled are either delivered to a household recycling center or picked up from curbside bins then sorted cleaned and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing new products. In the strictest sense recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material for example used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used polystyrene foam into new polystyrene. However this is often difficult or too expensive compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources so recycling of many products or materials involves their reuse in producing different materials for example paperboard instead. Another form of recycling is the salvage of certain materials from complex products either due to their intrinsic value such as lead from car batteries or gold from printed circuit boards or due to their hazardous nature e.g. removal and reuse of mercury from thermometers and thermostats . Recycling has been a common practice for most of human history with recorded advocates as far back as Plato in the fourth century BC. citation needed During periods when resources were scarce and hard to come by archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste such as ash broken tools and pottery implying more waste was being recycled in the absence of new material. In pre industrial times there is evidence of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for perpetual reuse. Paper recycling was first recorded in when Japanese shops sold repulped paper. In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by dustmen and downcycled as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring virgin material as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas. In Benjamin Law developed the process of turning rags into shoddy and mungo wool in Batley Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin wool. The West Yorkshire shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early th century to at least . Industrialization spurred demand for affordable materials aside from rags ferrous scrap metals were coveted as they were cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads both purchased and sold scrap metal in the th century and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early th century. Many secondary goods were collected processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery pots pans and other sources of metal. By World War I thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities taking advantage of market forces to recycle post consumer materials back into industrial production. Beverage bottles were recycled with a refundable deposit at some drink manufacturers in Great Britain and Ireland around notably Schweppes. An official recycling system with refundable deposits was established in Sweden for bottles in and aluminum beverage cans in the law led to a recycling rate for beverage containers of percent depending on type and a glass bottle can be refilled over times on average. New chemical industries created in the late th century both invented new materials e.g. Bakelite and promised to transform valueless into valuable materials. Proverbially you could not make a silk purse of a sow s ear until the US firm Arthur D. Little published in On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows Ears its research proving that when chemistry puts on overalls and gets down to business ... new values appear. New and better paths are opened to reach the goals desired. Recycling or salvage as it was then usually known was a major issue for governments throughout World War II. Financial constraints and significant material shortages due to war efforts made it necessary for countries to reuse goods and recycle materials. These resource shortages caused by the world wars and other such world changing occurrences greatly encouraged recycling. The struggles of war claimed much of the material resources available leaving little for the civilian population. It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste as recycling offered an extra source of materials allowing people to make the most of what was available to them. Recycling household materials meant more resources for war efforts and a better chance of victory. Massive government promotion campaigns such as the National Salvage Campaign in Britain and the Salvage for Victory campaign in the United States were carried out on the home front in every combative nation urging citizens to donate metal paper rags and rubber as a matter of patriotism. A considerable investment in recycling occurred in the s due to rising energy costs. Recycling aluminum uses only of the energy required by virgin production glass paper and other metals have less dramatic but very significant energy savings when recycled feedstock is used. Although consumer electronics such as the television have been popular since the s recycling of them was almost unheard of until early . The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. After these schemes were set up many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper silver iron silicon nickel and gold during the recycling process. The s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream in e waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances especially after strict laws were implemented in . As of the European Union had about of world share of the waste and recycling industries with over companies employing persons with a turnover of billion. Countries have to reach recycling rates of at least while the lead countries were around and the EU average was as of . The EU average has been rising steadily to in . In changes in the recycling market have sparked a global crisis in the industry. On December China announced its National Sword policy setting new standards for imports of recyclable material and banning materials that were deemed too dirty or hazardous . The new policy caused drastic disruptions in the global market in recycling and reduced the prices of scrap plastic and low grade paper. Exports of recyclable materials from G countries to China dropped dramatically with many exports shifting to countries in southeast Asia. The crisis generated significant concern about the practices and environmental sustainability of the recycling industry. The abrupt shift caused countries to accept more recyclable materials than they could process raising fundamental questions about shipping recycling waste from economically developed countries to countries with few environmental regulations a practice that predated the crisis. For a recycling program to work having a large stable supply of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such a supply mandatory recycling collection container deposit legislation and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city s waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target. Container deposit legislation involves offering a refund for the return of certain containers typically glass plastic and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful often resulting in an percent recycling rate. Despite such good results the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas. A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers costs. An alternative way to increase the supply of recyclates is to ban the disposal of certain materials as waste often including used oil old batteries tires and garden waste. One aim of this method is to create a viable economy for proper disposal of banned products. Care must be taken that enough of these recycling services exist or such bans simply lead to increased illegal dumping. Legislation has also been used to increase and maintain a demand for recycled materials. Four methods of such legislation exist minimum recycled content mandates utilization rates procurement policies and recycled product labeling. Both minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose and claim that they rob the industry of necessary flexibility. Governments have used their own purchasing power to increase recycling demand through what are called procurement policies . These policies are either set asides which reserve a certain amount of spending solely towards recycled products or price preference programs which provide a larger budget when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific cases in the United States for example the Environmental Protection Agency mandates the purchase of oil paper tires and building insulation from recycled or re refined sources whenever possible. The final government regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are required to label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product including the packaging consumers are better able to make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can then choose more environmentally conscious options prompt producers to increase the amount of recycled material in their products and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled. Recyclate is a raw material that is sent to and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which will be used to form new products. The material is collected in various methods and delivered to a facility where it undergoes re manufacturing so that it can be used in the production of new materials or products. For example plastic bottles that are collected can be re used and made into plastic pellets a new product. The quality of recyclates is recognized as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non target material and other non recyclable material. Only target material is likely to be recycled so a higher amount of non target and non recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product. A high proportion of non target and non recyclable material can make it more difficult for re processors to achieve high quality recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality it is more likely to end up being down cycled or in more extreme cases sent to other recovery options or landfilled. For example to facilitate the re manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re melt process. The quality of recyclate not only supports high quality recycling but it can also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing reusing and keeping products out of landfills. High quality recycling can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected. Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to local governments households and businesses. Pursuing high quality recycling can also provide consumer and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that sector. There are many actions along the recycling supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It begins with the waste producers who place non target and non recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non target and non recyclable material. Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate. The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland sets out a number of proposed actions that the Scottish Government would like to take forward in order to drive up the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market. The plan s objectives are to The plan focuses on three key areas with fourteen actions which were identified to increase the quality of materials collected sorted and presented to the processing market in Scotland. The three areas of focus are A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are drop off centers buy back centers and curbside collection . Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection commingled recyclables and source separation. A waste collection vehicle generally picks up the waste. At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste paper especially being too soiled to reprocess but has advantages as well the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location. In a commingled or single stream system all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post collection cleaning but does require public education on what materials are recyclable. Source separation is the other extreme where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates but incurs additional operating costs for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required which must be successful if recyclate contamination is to be avoided. In Oregon USA its environmental authority Oregon DEQ surveyed multi family property managers and about half of them reported problems including contamination of recyclables due to trespassers such as transients gaining access to the collection areas. Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled mixed waste collection. However advances in sorting technology have lowered this overhead substantially. Many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to what is called co mingled collection. Buy back centers differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post processed material can then be sold. If this is profitable this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases if unprofitable it increases the emission of greenhouse gasses. Government subsidies are necessary to make buy back centres a viable enterprise. In according to the U.S. National Waste Recycling Association it costs on average to process a ton of material which can be resold for . In the US the value per ton of mixed recyclables was in in and in . In glass is essentially valueless because of the low cost of sand its major component low oil costs thwarts plastic recycling. In Napa California was reimbursed about of its costs in recycling. Drop off centers require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a central location either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput. For some waste materials such as plastic recent technical devices called recyclebots enable a form of distributed recycling. Preliminary life cycle analysis LCA indicates that such distributed recycling of HDPE to make filament of D printers in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy. Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a central collection facility the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages many of which involve automated processes such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour. Some plants can now sort the materials automatically known as single stream recycling. In plants a variety of materials is sorted such as paper different types of plastics glass metals food scraps and most types of batteries. A percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist. Initially the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage as they can cause later machinery to jam. Next automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic PET and HDPE are collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel. Strong magnets are used to separate out ferrous metals such as iron steel and tin cans. Non ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminum cans which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream. Finally glass is sorted according to its color brown amber green or clear. It may either be sorted by hand or via an automated machine that uses colored filters to detect different colors. Glass fragments smaller than millimetres . in across cannot be sorted automatically and are mixed together as glass fines . This process of recycling as well as reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it reduces amount of waste sent to landfills conserves natural resources saves energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new products that can be consumed again such as paper plastic and glass. The City and County of San Francisco s Department of the Environment is attempting to achieve a citywide goal of generating zero waste by . San Francisco s refuse hauler Recology operates an effective recyclables sorting facility which helped the city reach a record breaking diversion rate of . Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home of waste in the United Kingdom is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods like retail stores warehouses and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present. The glass lumber wood pulp and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials however old rubber tires may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit. Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In the International Resource Panel hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates. The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the th and into the st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example the in use stock of copper in the USA grew from to kg per capita between and . The report authors observed that as metals are inherently recyclable the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground the term urban mining has been coined with this idea in mind . However they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end of life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology. The military recycles some metals. The U.S. Navy s Ship Disposal Program uses ship breaking to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an artificial reef. Uranium is a very dense metal that has qualities superior to lead and titanium for many military and industrial uses. The uranium left over from processing it into nuclear weapons and fuel for nuclear reactors is called depleted uranium and it is used by all branches of the U.S. military use for armour piercing shells and shielding. The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement selling their waste materials for profit. Some industries like the renewable energy industry and solar photovoltaic technology in particular are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams anticipating future demand during their rapid growth. Recycling of plastics is more difficult as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of quality. Recycling of PVC often results in downcycling of the material which means only products of lower quality standard can be made with the recycled material. A new approach which allows an equal level of quality is the Vinyloop process. It was used after the London Olympics to fulfill the PVC Policy. E waste is a growing problem accounting for million metric tons of global waste per year according to the EPA. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e waste responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti the Basel Convention was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU the United States National Computer Recycling Act to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere. In the recycling process television sets monitors cell phones and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is cheap enough. Other e waste is shredded to pieces roughly centimetres . in in size and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and capacitors which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to millimetres . in particles and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An eddy current ejects non ferrous metals which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid sorted and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs or the mercury backlight from LCDs. Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables. Some plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects for example PET water bottles can be converted into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase with each remelt. For some polymers it is possible to convert them back into monomers for example PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again. Another process involves the conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise thermal depolymerization process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers including thermoset materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the biopolymers in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in Carthage Missouri US uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result. Plastic Pyrolysis can convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels carbons. Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for pyrolysis The ideal recycling process can be differentiated into three loops one for manufacture production waste recycling and two for disposal of the product product and material recycling . The product s manufacturing phase which consists of material processing and fabrication forms the production waste recycling loop. Industrial waste materials are fed back into and reused in the same production process. The product s disposal process requires two recycling loops product recycling and material recycling. The product or product parts are reused in the product recycling phase. This happens in one of two ways the product is used retaining the product functionality reuse or the product continues to be used but with altered functionality further use . The product design is unmodified or only slightly modified in both scenarios. Product disassembly requires material recycling where product materials are recovered and recycled. Ideally the materials are processed so they can flow back into the production process. In order to meet recyclers needs while providing manufacturers a consistent uniform system a coding system was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in by the plastics industry through the Society of the Plastics Industry. Because municipal recycling programs traditionally have targeted packaging primarily bottles and containers the resin coding system offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream. Plastic products are printed with numbers depending on the type of resin. Type polyethylene terephthalate is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type high density polyethylene is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs laundry detergent bottles and some dishware. Type polyvinyl chloride includes items such as shampoo bottles shower curtains hula hoops credit cards wire jacketing medical equipment siding and piping. Type low density polyethylene is found in shopping bags squeezable bottles tote bags clothing furniture and carpet. Type is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles straws Tupperware and some automotive parts. Type is polystyrene and makes up meat trays egg cartons clamshell containers and compact disc cases. Type includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials and gallon water bottles cell phone and tablet frames safety goggles and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types and are the most commonly recycled. There is some debate over whether recycling is economically efficient. According to a Natural Resources Defense Council study waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per tons of waste material managed in contrast the collection processing and manufacturing of recycled materials creates or more jobs per tons. However the cost effectiveness of creating the additional jobs remains unproven. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study there are over recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US. Two years after New York City declared that implementing recycling programs would be a drain on the city New York City leaders realized that an efficient recycling system could save the city over million. Municipalities often see fiscal benefits from implementing recycling programs largely due to the reduced landfill costs. A study conducted by the Technical University of Denmark according to the Economist found that in percent of cases recycling is the most efficient method to dispose of household waste. However a assessment by the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute concluded that incineration was the most effective method for disposing of drink containers even aluminium ones. Fiscal efficiency is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call externalities which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills reduced energy consumption and reduced waste and resource consumption which leads to a reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About minerals are known of which only a few hundred are relatively common. Known reserves of phosphorus will be exhausted within the next years at current rates of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. citation needed To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has concluded in favor of recycling saying that recycling efforts reduced the country s carbon emissions by a net million metric tonnes in . In the United Kingdom the Waste and Resources Action Programme stated that Great Britain s recycling efforts reduce CO emissions by million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas as there are economies of scale involved. Certain requirements must be met for recycling to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates a system to extract those recyclates from the waste stream a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked without both an industrial market for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods recycling is incomplete and in fact only collection . Free market economist Julian Simon remarked There are three ways society can organize waste disposal a commanding b guiding by tax and subsidy and c leaving it to the individual and the market . These principles appear to divide economic thinkers today. Frank Ackerman favours a high level of government intervention to provide recycling services. He believes that recycling s benefit cannot be effectively quantified by traditional laissez faire economics. Allen Hershkowitz supports intervention saying that it is a public service equal to education and policing. He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal. Paul Calcott and Margaret Walls advocate the second option. A deposit refund scheme and a small refuse charge would encourage recycling but not at the expense of fly tipping. Thomas C. Kinnaman concludes that a landfill tax would force consumers companies and councils to recycle more. Most free market thinkers detest subsidy and intervention because they waste resources. Terry Anderson and Donald Leal think that all recycling programmes should be privately operated and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs. Daniel K. Benjamin argues that it wastes people s resources and lowers the wealth of a population. The National Waste Recycling Association NWRA then again reported in May that recycling and waste made a . billion economic impact in Ohio U.S. and employed people. Certain countries trade in unprocessed recyclates. Some have complained that the ultimate fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of being reprocessed. According to one report in America percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled. There are reports of illegal waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain without consideration for workers health or environmental damage. Although the Chinese government has banned these practices it has not been able to eradicate them. In the prices of recyclable waste plummeted before rebounding in . Cardboard averaged about tonne from to dropped to tonne and then went up to tonne in May . PET plastic averaged about tonne dropped to tonne and then moved up to tonne in May . Certain regions have difficulty using or exporting as much of a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled outside the American Midwest there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re inserted into the regular waste stream. Similarly the northwestern United States has difficulty finding markets for recycled newspaper given the large number of pulp mills in the region as well as the proximity to Asian markets. In other areas of the U.S. however demand for used newsprint has seen wide fluctuation. In some U.S. states a program called RecycleBank pays people to recycle receiving money from local municipalities for the reduction in landfill space which must be purchased. It uses a single stream process in which all material is automatically sorted.  Critics who dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from confirmation bias. Specifically critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from and outweigh the costs and energy saved in the production process also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging mining and other industries associated with production and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling. Much of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of sustainable design aims to solve this problem and was laid out in the book Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things by architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart. They suggest that every product and all packaging it requires should have a complete closed loop cycle mapped out for each component a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through biodegradation or be recycled indefinitely. Complete recycling is impossible from a practical standpoint. In summary substitution and recycling strategies only delay the depletion of non renewable stocks and therefore may buy time in the transition to true or strong sustainability which ultimately is only guaranteed in an economy based on renewable resources. While recycling diverts waste from entering directly into landfill sites current recycling misses the dissipative components. Complete recycling is impracticable as highly dispersed wastes become so diluted that the energy needed for their recovery becomes increasingly excessive. For example how will it ever be possible to recycle the numerous chlorinated organic hydrocarbons that have bioaccumulated in animal and human tissues across the globe the copper dispersed in fungicides the lead in widely applied paints or the zinc oxides present in the finely dispersed rubber powder that is abraded from automobile tires who As with environmental economics care must be taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example paperboard packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.  The amount of energy saved through recycling depends upon the material being recycled and the type of energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life cycle analysis using real energy values and in addition exergy which is a measure of useful energy can be used. In general it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials. Some scholars use emergy spelled with an m analysis for example budgets for the amount of energy of one kind exergy that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics based results. Using emergy life cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose followed by adaptive reuse systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product and then by product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product. The Energy Information Administration EIA states on its website that a paper mill uses percent less energy to make paper from recycled paper than it does to make paper from fresh lumber. Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling so the net energy consumption is the same. An emergy life cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash aluminum recycled concrete aggregate recycled plastic and steel yield higher efficiency ratios whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence the specific nature of the recycling process the methods used to analyse the process and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets. It is difficult to determine the amount of energy consumed or produced in waste disposal processes in broader ecological terms where causal relations dissipate into complex networks of material and energy flow. For example cities do not follow all the strategies of ecosystem development. Biogeochemical paths become fairly straight relative to wild ecosystems with very reduced recycling resulting in large flows of waste and low total energy efficiencies. By contrast in wild ecosystems one population s wastes are another population s resources and succession results in efficient exploitation of available resources. However even modernized cities may still be in the earliest stages of a succession that may take centuries or millennia to complete. How much energy is used in recycling also depends on the type of material being recycled and the process used to do so. Aluminium is generally agreed to use far less energy when recycled rather than being produced from scratch. The EPA states that recycling aluminum cans for example saves percent of the energy required to make the same amount of aluminum from its virgin source bauxite. In more than half of all aluminium cans produced came from recycled aluminium. Every year millions of tons of materials are being exploited from the earth s crust and processed into consumer and capital goods. After decades to centuries most of these materials are lost . With the exception of some pieces of art or religious relics they are no longer engaged in the consumption process. Where are they Recycling is only an intermediate solution for such materials although it does prolong the residence time in the anthroposphere. For thermodynamic reasons however recycling cannot prevent the final need for an ultimate sink. Economist Steven Landsburg has suggested that the sole benefit of reducing landfill space is trumped by the energy needed and resulting pollution from the recycling process. Others however have calculated through life cycle assessment that producing recycled paper uses less energy and water than harvesting pulping processing and transporting virgin trees. When less recycled paper is used additional energy is needed to create and maintain farmed forests until these forests are as self sustainable as virgin forests. Other studies have shown that recycling in itself is inefficient to perform the decoupling of economic development from the depletion of non renewable raw materials that is necessary for sustainable development. The international transportation or recycle material flows through ... different trade networks of the three countries result in different flows decay rates and potential recycling returns . As global consumption of a natural resources grows their depletion is inevitable. The best recycling can do is to delay complete closure of material loops to achieve percent recycling of nonrenewables is impossible as micro trace materials dissipate into the environment causing severe damage to the planet s ecosystems. Historically this was identified as the metabolic rift by Karl Marx who identified the unequal exchange rate between energy and nutrients flowing from rural areas to feed urban cities that create effluent wastes degrading the planet s ecological capital such as loss in soil nutrient production. Energy conservation also leads to what is known as Jevon s paradox where improvements in energy efficiency lowers the cost of production and leads to a rebound effect where rates of consumption and economic growth increases.  The amount of money actually saved through recycling depends on the efficiency of the recycling program used to do it. The Institute for Local Self Reliance argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors such as landfill fees and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add on to it and by redesigning their collection schedules and or trucks . In some cases the cost of recyclable materials also exceeds the cost of raw materials. Virgin plastic resin costs percent less than recycled resin. Additionally a United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA study that tracked the price of clear glass from July to August found that the average cost per ton ranged from to while a USGS report shows that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years to fell between . and .. Comparing the market cost of recyclable material with the cost of new raw materials ignores economic externalities the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic for instance may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively legal means such as a carbon tax can be used to bring externalities into the market so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost. The recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment in India and China generates a significant amount of pollution. Informal recycling in an underground economy of these countries has generated an environmental and health disaster. High levels of lead Pb polybrominated diphenylethers PBDEs polychlorinated dioxins and furans as well as polybrominated dioxins and furans PCDD Fs and PBDD Fs concentrated in the air bottom ash dust soil water and sediments in areas surrounding recycling sites.  Economist Steven Landsburg author of a paper entitled Why I Am Not an Environmentalist claimed that paper recycling actually reduces tree populations. He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish their forests large demands for paper lead to large forests while reduced demand for paper leads to fewer farmed forests. When foresting companies cut down trees more are planted in their place however such farmed forests are inferior to virgin forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not able to fix the soil as quickly as virgin forests causing widespread soil erosion and often requiring large amounts of fertilizer to maintain while containing little tree and wild life biodiversity compared to virgin forests. Also the new trees planted are not as big as the trees that were cut down and the argument that there will be more trees is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings. In particular wood from tropical rainforests is rarely harvested for paper because of their heterogeneity. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is subsistence farming of deforestation and commercial agriculture which is linked to food not paper production. In some countries recycling is performed by the entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni zabbaleen the rag and bone man waste picker and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable either by law or economies of scale the poor are more likely to be driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing market. To compensate for this loss of income a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However in Brazil and Argentina waste pickers informal recyclers work alongside the authorities in fully or semi funded cooperatives allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job. Because the social support of a country is likely to be less than the loss of income to the poor undertaking recycling there is a greater chance the poor will come in conflict with the large recycling organizations. This means fewer people can decide if certain waste is more economically reusable in its current form rather than being reprocessed. Contrasted to the recycling poor the efficiency of their recycling may actually be higher for some materials because individuals have greater control over what is considered waste . One labor intensive underused waste is electronic and computer waste. Because this waste may still be functional and wanted mostly by those on lower incomes who may sell or use it at a greater efficiency than large recyclers. Some recycling advocates believe that laissez faire individual based recycling does not cover all of society s recycling needs. Thus it does not negate the need for an organized recycling program. Local government can consider the activities of the recycling poor as contributing to property blight. Changes that have been demonstrated to increase recycling rates include Between and the world production of plastic resins increased fold while recovery of the material remained below percent. Many studies have addressed recycling behaviour and strategies to encourage community involvement in recycling programmes. It has been argued that recycling behaviour is not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long term planning whereas humans have evolved to be sensitive to short term survival goals and that to overcome this innate predisposition the best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programmes. However recent studies have concluded that social pressure is unviable in this context. One reason for this is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of to individuals common to nomadic hunter gatherer peoples but not in communities numbering in the millions as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view. Art objects are more and more often made from recycled material. In a study done by social psychologist Shawn Burn it was found that personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is the most effective way to increase recycling within a community. In his study he had block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn t have friends and neighbors that recycled. Many schools have created recycling awareness clubs in order to give young students an insight on recycling. These schools believe that the clubs actually encourage students to not only recycle at school but at home as well.",FALSE
"4",4,"sustainable development","/wiki/Sustainable_development",TRUE,0,"system|sustainable|","Sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while simultaneously sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend"," Sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while simultaneously sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations. While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the Brundtland Report it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed it has shifted to focus more on economic development social development and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that the term sustainability should be viewed as humanity s target goal of human ecosystem equilibrium homeostasis while sustainable development refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability . Modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving natural resources and ecosystems as the two are usually seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug vague to economic development turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. unbalanced opinion The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called Managed Sustainable Development MSD . attribution needed The concept of sustainable development has been and still is subject to criticism including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a non renewable resource since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth s finite stock this perspective renders the Industrial Revolution as a whole unsustainable. f f It has also been argued that the meaning of the concept has opportunistically been stretched from conservation management to economic development and that the Brundtland Report promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with an ambiguous and insubstantial concept attached as a public relations slogan see below . Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining world processes of productivity indefinitely natural or human made by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems. Sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social political and economic challenges faced by humanity. Sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations responsibility to regenerate maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations. Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in Europe during the th and th centuries. In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England John Evelyn argued that sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner in order to stop the destructive over exploitation of natural resources in his essay Sylva. In Hans Carl von Carlowitz a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published Sylvicultura oeconomica a page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister Jean Baptiste Colbert von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield. His work influenced others including Alexander von Humboldt and Georg Ludwig Hartig eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like Gifford Pinchot first head of the US Forest Service whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources and Aldo Leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the s. Following the publication of Rachel Carson s Silent Spring in the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. Kenneth E. Boulding in his influential essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources. One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the Club of Rome in in its classic report on the Limits to Growth written by a group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Describing the desirable state of global equilibrium the authors wrote We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people. Following the Club of Rome report an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on Growth and Its Implication for the Future Roundtable Press for the US Congress the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. William Flynn Martin David Dodson Gray and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman John Dingell. citation needed In the International Union for the Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and introduced the term sustainable development . Two years later the United Nations World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged. In the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released the report Our Common Future commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development. Since the Brundtland Report the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth . In the UN Conference on Environment and Development published the Earth Charter which outlines the building of a just sustainable and peaceful global society in the st century. The action plan Agenda for sustainable development identified information integration and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross sectoral co ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore Agenda emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development. Under the principles of the United Nations Charter the Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development including economic development social development and environmental protection. Broadly defined sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural produced and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education public health and standard of living. citation needed A study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains ecology economics politics and culture. In September the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the universal integrated and transformative Agenda for Sustainable Development a set of Sustainable Development Goals SDGs . The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year to . Education for Sustainable Development ESD is defined as education that encourages changes in knowledge skills values and attitudes to enable a more sustainable and equitable society. ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the economic social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. The concept of ESD was born from the need for education to address the growing and changing environmental challenges facing the planet. In order to do this education must change to provide the knowledge skills values and attitudes that empower learners to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time education must be strengthened in all agendas programmes and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into education and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD is holistic and transformational education and concerns learning content and outcomes pedagogy and the learning environment UNESCO . With regards to learning content such as curricula the complex sustainability challenges facing societies cut across boundaries and multiple thematic areas. Education must therefore address key issues such as climate change poverty and sustainable production. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the curriculum to prepare learners to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce learning outcomes that include core competencies such as critical and systemic thinking collaborative decision making and taking responsibility for the present and future generations. In order to deliver such diverse and evolving issues ESD uses innovative pedagogy encouraging teaching and learning in an interactive learner centered way that enables exploratory action oriented and transformative learning. Learners are enabled to think critically and systematically develop values and attitudes for a sustainable future. Since traditional single directional delivery of knowledge is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as responsible citizens ESD entails rethinking the learning environment physical and virtual. ESD applies to all levels of formal non formal and informal education as an integral part of lifelong learning. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of educators and policy support at international regional national and local levels helps drive changes in learning institutions. Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development. The launch of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade stated in the Aichi Nagoya Declaration on ESD UNESCO endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD GAP in the th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by UN General Assembly Resolution A RES and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in the GAP aims to scale up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role along with its partners in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of ESD are promoted through formal non formal and informal education. International recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development the UN Conference on Environment and Development UNCED in Rio de Janeiro Brazil the World Summit on Sustainable Development WSSD in Johannesburg South Africa and the UN Conference on Sustainable Development UNCSD in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the Paris Agreement Article also recognize the importance of ESD. Today ESD is arguably at the heart of the Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals SDGs United Nations . The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas people planet prosperity peace and partnership in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity. ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target . of SDG which aims to ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other SDGs UNESCO . Sustainable development or sustainability has been described in terms of three spheres dimensions domains or pillars i.e. the environment the economy and society. The three sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist Rene Passet in . It has also been worded as economic environmental and social or ecology economy and equity . This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture institutions or governance or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social ecology economics politics and culture thus bringing economics back inside the social and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural. The ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments. Also termed human ecology this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health. Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air water food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which in this sense extends to all species. Environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since natural resources are derived from the environment the state of air water and the climate are of particular concern. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report outlines current knowledge about scientific technical and socio economic information concerning climate change and lists options for adaptation and mitigation. Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This for example entails using water sustainably utilizing renewable energy and sustainable material supplies e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity . citation needed An unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital the sum total of nature s resources is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically the long term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support. citation needed If the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity. citation needed Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme Horizon which is also open to participation worldwide. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons in that instead of taking something out something is put into the commons. When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed then it becomes only natural to pollute as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons. So the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it through taxes or fines more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge. So one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual but in the absence of any direct consequences the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public. Once again this issue needs to be addressed. Because left unaddressed the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way. So this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use. Sustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil water biodiversity surrounding or downstream resources as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighbouring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally passing on a conserved or improved natural resource biotic and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted. Elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture agroforestry mixed farming multiple cropping and crop rotation. It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands Herman Daly . citation needed Numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist including organic certification Rainforest Alliance Fair Trade UTZ Certified Bird Friendly and the Common Code for the Coffee Community C . Organizations It has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets called natural capital. Economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product. This model of unlimited personal and GDP growth may be over. Sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption. According to ecological economist Malte Faber ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature justice and time. Issues of intergenerational equity irreversibility of environmental change uncertainty of long term outcomes and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation. As early as the s the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems . Scientists in many fields have highlighted The Limits to Growth and economists have presented alternatives for example a steady state economy to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet. In the economist Edward Barbier published the study The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other. A World Bank study from concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability in macroeconomics or purely environmental. Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare eventually reaching a golden rule steady state. The study Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms found three pillars of sustainable development interlinkage intergenerational equity and dynamic efficiency. But Gilbert Rist points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes From this angle sustainable development looks like a cover up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really development not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies. The World Bank a leading producer of environmental knowledge continues to advocate the win win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts. Herman Daly an economist for the Bank from to writes When authors of WDR the highly influential World Development Report that featured the environment were drafting the report they called me asking for examples of win win strategies in my work. What could I say None exists in that pure form there are trade offs not win wins. But they want to see a world of win wins based on articles of faith not fact. I wanted to contribute because WDRs are important in the Bank because task managers read them to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are or what I find in my work... A meta review in looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of sustainability policies . A study in asked if we consume too much. A study concluded in that knowledge manufactured and human capital health and education has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world. It has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics. A meta review in identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare. According to free market environmentalist John Baden the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights . They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment. The State can in this context create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment . Misum Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets based at Stockholm School of Economics aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors on Sustainable Markets. Misum is a cross disciplinary and multi stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms Sustainability in Financial Markets Mistra Financial Systems Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio Economic Development. The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth air and water but also human interactions with these things with nature and what humans have created as their surroundings. As countries around the world continue to advance economically they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow but not at the expense of the public good. In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited. Benefit cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action. Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit cost analysis. citation needed Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy renewable energy sources like hydroelectric solar and wind energy produce far less pollution. Solar energy is commonly used on public parking meters street lights and the roof of buildings. Wind power has expanded quickly its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of was . . Most of California s fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low income communities and have traditionally suffered the most from California s fossil fuel energy system. These communities are historically left out during the decision making process and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables providing better social equity to these communities. Overall and in the long run sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies. Main article Green manufacturing and Distributed manufacturing One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people to meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as appropriate technology which is an ideological movement and its manifestations originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist E. F. Schumacher in his influential work Small is Beautiful. And now covers a wide range of technologies. Both Schumacher and many modern day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people centered. Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles which have led to Open Source Appropriate Technology OSAT and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet. OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development. Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one third of all gases produced are due to transportation. Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change. Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP sustainable transport can help create jobs improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people s time and household income as well as government budgets making investment in sustainable transport a win win opportunity. Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long term and short term implementations. An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg Germany. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation cycling and walking along with large areas where cars are not allowed. Since many Western countries are highly automobile oriented the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About of their travel involves cars. Therefore California is one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as Other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence based sustainable transportation policies. citation needed The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm s efficient use of natural capital. This eco efficiency is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact. This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD under the following definition Eco efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life cycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity DeSimone and Popoff . Similar to the eco efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio efficiency describes the relation between a firm s value added and its social impact. Whereas it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive e.g. corporate giving creation of employment or negative e.g. work accidents mobbing of employees human rights abuses . Depending on the type of impact socio efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts i.e. accidents per value added or maximise positive social impacts i.e. donations per value added in relation to the value added. citation needed Both eco efficiency and socio efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win win situations. However as Dyllick and Hockerts point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco effectiveness socio effectiveness sufficiency and eco equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached. citation needed CASI Global New York CSR Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company. CASI Global At the present time sustainable development can reduce poverty. Sustainable development reduces poverty through financial among other things a balanced budget environmental living conditions and social including equality of income means. In sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and International Style architecture as well as opposing to solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints. Both trends started in the s. Sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain. citation needed A study concluded that social indicators and therefore sustainable development indicators are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy making. The International Institute for Sustainable Development has similarly developed a political policy framework linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas The United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation authorisation legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles see above . Working with a different emphasis some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development since the triple bottom line dimensions of economic environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context the Agenda for culture and the United Cities and Local Governments UCLG Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement Culture Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development passed on November in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders rd World Congress of UCLG held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The Circles of Sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic ecological political and cultural sustainability. Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence Sustainable Development in a Diverse World sponsored by the European Union integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at UNESCO Vito Di Bari in his manifesto of art and architectural movement Neo Futurism whose name was inspired by the United Nations report Our Common Future. The Circles of Sustainability approach used by Metropolis defines the fourth cultural domain as practices discourses and material expressions which over time express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning. Recently human centered design and cultural collaboration have been popular frameworks for sustainable development in marginalized communities. These frameworks involve open dialogue which entails sharing debating and discussing as well as holistic evaluation of the site of development. Especially when working on sustainable development in marginalized communities cultural emphasis is a crucial factor in project decisions since it largely affects aspects of their lives and traditions. Collaborators utilize articulation theory in co designing. This allows for them to understand each other s thought process and their comprehension of the sustainable projects. By using the method of co design the beneficiaries holistic needs are being considered. Final decisions and implementations are made with respect to sociocultural and ecological factors. The user oriented framework relies heavily on user participation and user feedback in the planning process. Users are able to provide new perspective and ideas which can be considered in a new round of improvements and changes. It is said that increased user participation in the design process can garner a more comprehensive understanding of the design issues due to more contextual and emotional transparency between researcher and participant. A key element of human centered design is applied ethnography which was a research method adopted from cultural anthropology. This research method requires researchers to be fully immersed in the observation so that implicit details are also recorded. Many communities express environmental concerns so life cycle analysis is often conducted when assessing the sustainability of a product or prototype. The assessment is done in stages with meticulous cycles of planning design implementation and evaluation. The decision to choose materials is heavily weighted on its longevity renewability and efficiency. These factors ensure that researchers are conscious of community values that align with positive environmental social and economic impacts. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development UNCSD also known as Rio was the third international conference on sustainable development which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the Sustainable Development Goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However few nations met the World Wide Fund for Nature s definition of sustainable development criteria established in . Although some nations are more developed than others all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms. In a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them. Nevertheless a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible. Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations trial and error . The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality comparability objective function and the necessary resources. However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project The Cuban born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral long term cost benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project activity or enterprise. Furthermore this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources. citation needed Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council s USGBC Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED . This design incorporates some ecological economic and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmospheric emission reduction material and resources efficiency and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building. citation needed Recent research efforts created also the SDEWES Index to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy water and environment systems. The SDEWES Index consists of dimensions indicators and close to sub indicators. It is currently applied to cities. The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital economic social and natural which may be non substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible. Leading ecological economist and steady state theorist Herman Daly for example points to the fact that natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco system services such as the protection provided by the ozone layer or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi functionality of many natural resources. Forests for example not only provide the raw material for paper which can be substituted quite easily but they also maintain biodiversity regulate water flow and absorb CO. citation needed Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The loss of biodiversity for example is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates. Moreover the depletion of natural and social capital may have non linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can for example absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake s ecosystem to break down suddenly. citation needed If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn point to four types of market failure as possible explanations First while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised the costs are often externalised i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general . Second natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason often the link between cause and effect is obscured making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a business as usual mentality. citation needed Main page Education for sustainable development Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive to continue to learn to solve problems to be creative and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives a quiet revolution is set in motion education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world. Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering finance supply chain and operations is gaining weight age. Multiple institutes including Wharton Columbia CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability. Corporate s prefer employees certified in sustainability. Reference The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania Columbia University in the City of New York CASI Global It has been argued that since the s the concept of sustainable development has changed from conservation management to economic development whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat. In the s the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the s however the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries and not just in Africa . This was a strategy of economic development and the strategy was carried even further by the Brundtland Commission s report on Our Common Future when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application. In effect the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers. But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the ..............................................use of renewable resources only like forestry to now also accounting for the use of non renewable resources like minerals . This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally there can be no such thing as overall sustainable development in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth s finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non renewable resource even with substantial recycling effort and use rates . Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock. In effect it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable. f f One critic has argued that the Brundtland Commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of sustainable development attached as a public relations slogan The report on Our Common Future was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II the notion of development had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the s and s this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights basic human needs and finally ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth also in the rich countries who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out as usual. When the discussion switched to global ecological limits to growth the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency or what was termed a change in the quality of growth . However most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early th century already and as usual only this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of sustainable development has marched on worldwide. This article incorporates text from a free content work.

"5",5,"industrial ecology","/wiki/Industrial_ecology",TRUE,0,"study|system|material|energy|material|","Industrial ecology IE is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems"," Industrial ecology IE is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems. The global industrial economy can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the Earth and transform those resources into commodities which can be bought and sold to meet the needs of humanity. Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function. Industrial ecologists are often concerned with the impacts that industrial activities have on the environment with use of the planet s supply of natural resources and with problems of waste disposal. Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of engineering economics sociology toxicology and the natural sciences. Industrial ecology has been defined as a systems based multidisciplinary discourse that seeks to understand emergent behaviour of complex integrated human natural systems . The field approaches issues of sustainability by examining problems from multiple perspectives usually involving aspects of sociology the environment economy and technology. The name comes from the idea that the analogy of natural systems should be used as an aid in understanding how to design sustainable industrial systems. Industrial ecology is concerned with the shifting of industrial process from linear open loop systems in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste to a closed loop system where wastes can become inputs for new processes. Much of the research focuses on the following areas Industrial ecology seeks to understand the way in which industrial systems for example a factory an ecoregion or national or global economy interact with the biosphere. Natural ecosystems provide a metaphor for understanding how different parts of industrial systems interact with one another in an ecosystem based on resources and infrastructural capital rather than on natural capital. It seeks to exploit the idea that natural systems do not have waste in them to inspire sustainable design. Along with more general energy conservation and material conservation goals and redefining commodity markets and product stewardship relations strictly as a service economy industrial ecology is one of the four objectives of Natural Capitalism. This strategy discourages forms of amoral purchasing arising from ignorance of what goes on at a distance and implies a political economy that values natural capital highly and relies on more instructional capital to design and maintain each unique industrial ecology. Industrial ecology was popularized in in a Scientific American article by Robert Frosch and Nicholas E. Gallopoulos. Frosch and Gallopoulos vision was why would not our industrial system behave like an ecosystem where the wastes of a species may be resource to another species Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another thus reducing use of raw materials pollution and saving on waste treatment A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of Kalundborg. Here several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant an oil refinery a pharmaceutical plant a plasterboard factory an enzyme manufacturer a waste company and the city itself. Another example is the Rantasalmi EIP in Rantasalmi Finland. While this country has had previous organically formed EIP s the park at Rantasalmi is Finland s first planned EIP. The scientific field Industrial Ecology has grown quickly in recent years. The Journal of Industrial Ecology since the International Society for Industrial Ecology since and the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology since give Industrial Ecology a strong and dynamic position in the international scientific community. Industrial Ecology principles are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the Circular Economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the Circular Economy has yet to be formalized generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using waste heat from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. The hope is that strategy such as this will create a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by products. One of the central principles of Industrial Ecology is the view that societal and technological systems are bounded within the biosphere and do not exist outside it. Ecology is used as a metaphor due to the observation that natural systems reuse materials and have a largely closed loop cycling of nutrients. Industrial Ecology approaches problems with the hypothesis that by using similar principles as natural systems industrial systems can be improved to reduce their impact on the natural environment as well. The table shows the general metaphor. IE examines societal issues and their relationship with both technical systems and the environment. Through this holistic view IE recognizes that solving problems must involve understanding the connections that exist between these systems various aspects cannot be viewed in isolation. Often changes in one part of the overall system can propagate and cause changes in another part. Thus you can only understand a problem if you look at its parts in relation to the whole. Based on this framework IE looks at environmental issues with a systems thinking approach. A good IE example with these societal impacts can be found at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland. The Lagoon uses super heated water from a local geothermal power plant to fill mineral rich basins that have become recreational healing centers. In this sense the industrial process of energy production uses its wastewater to provide a crucial resource for the dependent recreational industry. Take a city for instance. A city can be divided into commercial areas residential areas offices services infrastructures and so forth. These are all sub systems of the big city system. Problems can emerge in one sub system but the solution has to be global. Let s say the price of housing is rising dramatically because there is too high a demand for housing. One solution would be to build new houses but this will lead to more people living in the city leading to the need for more infrastructure like roads schools more supermarkets etc. This system is a simplified interpretation of reality whose behaviors can be predicted . In many cases the systems IE deals with are complex systems. Complexity makes it difficult to understand the behavior of the system and may lead to rebound effects. Due to unforeseen behavioral change of users or consumers a measure taken to improve environmental performance does not lead to any improvement or may even worsen the situation. Moreover life cycle thinking is also a very important principle in industrial ecology. It implies that all environmental impacts caused by a product system or project during its life cycle are taken into account. In this context life cycle includes The transport necessary between these stages is also taken into account as well as if relevant extra stages such as reuse remanufacture and recycle. Adopting a life cycle approach is essential to avoid shifting environmental impacts from one life cycle stage to another. This is commonly referred to as problem shifting. For instance during the re design of a product one can choose to reduce its weight thereby decreasing use of resources. It is possible that the lighter materials used in the new product will be more difficult to dispose of. The environmental impacts of the product gained during the extraction phase are shifted to the disposal phase. Overall environmental improvements are thus null. A final important principle of IE is its integrated approach or multidisciplinarity. IE takes into account three different disciplines social sciences including economics technical sciences and environmental sciences. The challenge is to merge them into a single approach. The Kalundborg industrial park is located in Denmark. This industrial park is special because companies reuse each other s waste which then becomes by products . For example the Energy E Asns Power Station produces gypsum as a by product of the electricity generation process this gypsum becomes a resource for the BPB Gyproc A S which produces plasterboards. This is one example of a system inspired by the biosphere technosphere metaphor in ecosystems the waste from one organism is used as inputs to other organisms in industrial systems waste from a company is used as a resource by others. Apart from the direct benefit of incorporating waste into the loop the use of an eco industrial park can be a means of making renewable energy generating plants like Solar PV more economical and environmentally friendly. In essence this assists the growth of the renewable energy industry and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil fuels. Additional examples of industrial ecology include The ecosystem metaphor popularized by Frosch and Gallopoulos has been a valuable creative tool for helping researchers look for novel solutions to difficult problems. Recently it has been pointed out that this metaphor is based largely on a model of classical ecology and that advancements in understanding ecology based on complexity science have been made by researchers such as C. S. Holling James J. Kay and further advanced in terms of contemporary ecology by others. For industrial ecology this may mean a shift from a more mechanistic view of systems to one where sustainability is viewed as an emergent property of a complex system. To explore this further several researchers are working with agent based modeling techniques . Exergy analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently. The term exergy was coined by Zoran Rant in but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs. In recent decades utilization of exergy has spread outside physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology ecological economics systems ecology and energetics. Another great example of industrial ecology both in practice and in potential is the Burnside Cleaner Production Centre in Burnside Nova Scotia. They play a role in facilitating the greening of over businesses that are located in Burnside Eastern Canada s largest industrial park. The creation of waste exchange is a big part of what they work towards which will promote strong industrial ecology relationships.",FALSE
"6",6,"waste management","/wiki/Waste_management",TRUE,0,"action|waste|","Waste management or waste disposal are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal","Waste management or waste disposal are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection transport treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process. Waste can be solid liquid or gaseous and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste including industrial biological and household. In some cases waste can pose a threat to human health. Waste is produced by human activity for example the extraction and processing of raw materials. Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on human health the environment or aesthetics. Waste management practices are not uniform among countries developed and developing nations regions urban and rural areas and residential and industrial sectors can all take different approaches. A large portion of waste management practices deal with municipal solid waste MSW which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household industrial and commercial activity. The waste hierarchy refers to the Rs reduce reuse and recycle which classifies waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of waste minimisation. The waste hierarchy is the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of end waste see resource recovery. The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek alternative uses for the waste that has been generated i.e. by re use. The next is recycling which includes composting. Following this step is material recovery and waste to energy. The final action is disposal in landfills or through incineration without energy recovery. This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented diverted or recovered. page needed The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life cycle for each product. The life cycle begins with design then proceeds through manufacture distribution and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy s stages of reduce reuse and recycle. Each stage in the life cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention to rethink the need for the product to redesign to minimize waste potential to extend its use. page needed Product life cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world s limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste. Resource efficiency reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish. page needed Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal. The polluter pays principle mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material. Throughout most of history the amount of waste generated by humans was insignificant due to low population density and low societal levels of the exploitation of natural resources as well as industrial since few decades. Common waste produced during pre modern times was mainly ashes and human biodegradable waste and these were released back into the ground locally with minimum environmental impact. Tools made out of wood or metal were generally reused or passed down through the generations. However some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular the Maya of Central America had a fixed monthly ritual in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps. Following the onset of industrialisation and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in England the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations. Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as when Corbyn Morris in London proposed that ... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance it is proposed that the cleaning of this city should be put under one uniform public management and all the filth be...conveyed by the Thames to proper distance in the country . However it was not until the mid th century spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population in of the social reformer Edwin Chadwick in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city s population. In the UK the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The Metropolitan Board of Works was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the Public Health Act made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in moveable receptacles for disposal the first concept for a dust bin. The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants or as they were then called destructors . In the first incinerator was built in Nottingham by Manlove Alliott Co. Ltd. to the design of Alfred Fryer. However these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas. Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the th century in other large cities of Europe and North America. In New York City became the first U.S. city with public sector garbage management. Early garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the s in Britain. These were soon equipped with hopper mechanisms where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in to incorporate a hydraulic compactor. Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas especially those in less developed countries do not have formal waste collection systems. Curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most European countries Canada New Zealand and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility. In some areas vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America. In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste salvaging recyclables and turning the rest into bio gas and soil conditioner. In San Francisco the local government established its Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in support of its goal of Zero waste by requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside Fantastic bin system blue for recyclables green for compostables and black for landfill bound materials provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco s sole refuse hauler Recology. The City s Pay As You Throw system charges customers by the volume of landfill bound materials which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City s Department of the Environment s Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve diversion the highest diversion rate in North America. Other businesses such as Waste Industries use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans. In most developed countries domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re use and recycling. In some areas such as Taipei the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate. citation needed Morocco has also seen benefits from implementing a million sanitary landfill system. While it might appear to be a costly investment the country s government predicts that it has saved them another million in damages or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly. Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by to percent. Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as thermal treatment . Incinerators convert waste materials into heat gas steam and ash. Incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous waste materials such as biological medical waste . Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants. Incineration is common in countries such as Japan where land is more scarce as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. Waste to energy WtE or energy from waste EfW are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent organic compounds such as dioxins furans and PAHs which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences. Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles a procedure called kerbside collection. In some communities the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins e.g. for paper plastics metals prior to its collection. In other communities all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as single stream recycling. The most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage cans copper such as wire steel from food and aerosol cans old steel furnishings or equipment rubber tyres polyethylene and PET bottles glass bottles and jars paperboard cartons newspapers magazines and light paper and corrugated fiberboard boxes. PVC LDPE PP and PS see resin identification code are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products such as computers and electronic equipment is more difficult due to the additional dismantling and separation required. The type of material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials. However certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July the Chinese government announced an import ban of categories of recyclables and solid waste including plastic textiles and mixed paper placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally which exported directly or indirectly to China. Recoverable materials that are organic in nature such as plant material food scraps and paper products can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition waste gas from the process such as methane can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat CHP cogeneration maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. See resource recovery . Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non recyclable waste materials into usable heat electricity or fuel through a variety of processes including combustion gasification pyrolyzation anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste to energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally waste to energy accounts for of waste management. The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel see above to fuel for boilers to generate steam and electricity in a turbine. Pyrolysis and gasification are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited oxygen availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high pressure. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products chemical refinery . The solid residue char can be further refined into products such as activated carbon. Gasification and advanced Plasma arc gasification are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas syngas composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and steam. An alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition hydrothermal monophasic oxidation . Pyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input such as plant waste food waste tyres placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels. Pyrolysis is a process of thermo chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of oxygen the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases. During pyrolysis the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with temperature. In industrial applications temperatures are above C F . Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal. Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals glass sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas. Compared to the process of incineration certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by products that contain alkali metals sulphur and chlorine. However pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO. Resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste which was intended for disposal for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources or convert to energy. These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility. Resource recovery is not only environmentally important but it is also cost effective. It decreases the amount of waste for disposal saves space in landfills and conserves natural resources. Resource recovery as opposed to waste management uses LCA life cycle analysis attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW Municipal Solid Waste a number of broad studies have indicated that administration source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non organic fraction and energy and compost fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path. As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial many items thrown away contain metals that can be recycled to create a profit such as the components in circuit boards. Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticulture. The recycled chips can cover paths walkways or arena surfaces. Application of rational and consistent waste management practices can yield a range of benefits including The management of waste is a key component in a business ability to maintain ISO accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through resource recovery practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like recycling materials such as glass food scraps paper and cardboard plastic bottles and metal. Recycled materials can often be sold to the construction industry. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel. This topic was on the agenda of the International WASCON conference in Spain in June and on the international Conference on Green Urbanism held in Italy October . citation needed Sewage sludge is produced by waste water treatment processes. Due to rapid urbanization there has been an increase in municipal waste water that results . . kg of sewage per population equivalent per year kg p.e year . Common disposal practices of sewage sludge are incineration composting and landfill. An important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created also known as waste reduction. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second hand products repairing broken items instead of buying new ones designing products to be refillable or reusable such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products such as disposable cutlery removing any food liquid remains from cans and packaging and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose for example lightweighting of beverage cans . While waste transport within a given country falls under national regulations trans boundary movement of waste is often subject to international treaties. A major concern to many countries in the world has been hazardous waste. The Basel Convention ratified by countries deprecates movement of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. The provisions of the Basel convention have been integrated into the EU waste shipment regulation. Radioactive waste although considered hazardous does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Basel Convention. Areas with developing economies often experience exhausted waste collection services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are worsening. page needed Problems with governance complicate the situation. Waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge due to weak institutions chronic under resourcing and rapid urbanization. page needed All of these challenges along with the lack of understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management affect the treatment of waste. full citation needed Traditionally the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new technologies such as RFID Radio Frequency Identification tags GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry.

Designers use this process to help critique their products. LCAs can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental concerns by The goal of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental effects assignable to products and services by quantifying all inputs and outputs of material flows and assessing how these material flows affect the environment. This information is used to improve processes support policy and provide a sound basis for informed decisions. The term life cycle refers to the notion that a fair holistic assessment requires the assessment of raw material production manufacture distribution use and disposal including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product s existence. citation needed There are two main types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to establish or attribute the burdens associated with the production and use of a product or with a specific service or process at a point in time typically the recent past . Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study oriented to the future which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA. citation needed The procedures of life cycle assessment LCA are part of the ISO environmental management standards in ISO and . ISO replaced earlier versions of ISO to ISO . GHG product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as PAS and the GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard. According to the ISO and standards a Life Cycle Assessment is carried out in four distinct phases as illustrated in the figure shown to the right. The phases are often interdependent in that the results of one phase will inform how other phases are completed. citation needed An LCA starts with an explicit statement of the goal and scope of the study which sets out the context of the study and explains how and to whom the results are to be communicated. This is a key step and the ISO standards require that the goal and scope of an LCA be clearly defined and consistent with the intended application. The goal and scope document therefore includes technical details that guide subsequent work and Life Cycle Inventory LCI analysis involves creating an inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water energy and raw materials and releases to air land and water. To develop the inventory a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities that are going to be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary including from the supply chain referred to as inputs from the technosphere . citation needed The data must be related to the functional unit defined in the goal and scope definition. Data can be presented in tables and some interpretations can be made already at this stage. The results of the inventory is an LCI which provides information about all inputs and outputs in the form of elementary flow to and from the environment from all the unit processes involved in the study. citation needed Inventory flows can number in the hundreds depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic i.e. representative industry averages or brand specific level that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level care has to be taken to ensure that questionnaires are completed by a representative sample of producers leaning toward neither the best nor the worst and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs typically aiming to account for of the mass of a product of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows even if they fall within the level of inputs. citation needed One area where data access is likely to be difficult is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the human made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources these resources are in theory recyclable however in a practical sense the primary goal is salvage. For an LCI these technosphere products supply chain products are those that have been produced by human and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a human made product as a means to an end will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA practitioner tools or that can be readily accessed are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions. citation needed Inventory analysis is followed by impact assessment. This phase of LCA is aimed at evaluating the significance of potential environmental impacts based on the LCI flow results. Classical life cycle impact assessment LCIA consists of the following mandatory elements citation needed In many LCAs characterization concludes the LCIA analysis this is also the last compulsory stage according to ISO . However in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps other optional LCIA elements normalization grouping and weighting may be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the region of interest the U.S. for example. Grouping consists of sorting and possibly ranking the impact categories. During weighting the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO generally advises against weighting stating that weighting shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public . This advice is often ignored resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting. citation needed Life cycle impacts can also be categorized under the several phases of the development production use and disposal of a product. Broadly speaking these impacts can be divided into First Impacts use impacts and end of life impacts. First Impacts include extraction of raw materials manufacturing conversion of raw materials into a product transportation of the product to a market or site construction installation and the beginning of the use or occupancy. Use impacts include physical impacts of operating the product or facility such as energy water etc. maintenance renovation and repairs required to continue to use the product or facility . End of life impacts include demolition and processing of waste or recyclable materials. citation needed Life Cycle Interpretation is a systematic technique to identify quantify check and evaluate information from the results of the life cycle inventory and or the life cycle impact assessment. The results from the inventory analysis and impact assessment are summarized during the interpretation phase. The outcome of the interpretation phase is a set of conclusions and recommendations for the study. According to ISO the interpretation should include citation needed A key purpose of performing life cycle interpretation is to determine the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair complete and accurate manner. Interpreting the results of an LCA is not as simple as is better than therefore Alternative A is the best choice Interpreting the results of an LCA starts with understanding the accuracy of the results and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category evaluating the sensitivity of these significant data elements assessing the completeness and consistency of the study and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed. citation needed More specifically the best alternative is the one that the LCA shows to have the least cradle to grave environmental negative impact on land sea and air resources. Based on a survey of LCA practitioners carried out in LCA is mostly used to support business strategy and R D as input to product or process design in education and for labeling or product declarations . LCA will be continuously integrated into the built environment as tools such as the European ENSLIC Building project guidelines for buildings or developed and implemented which provide practitioners guidance on methods to implement LCI data into the planning and design process. Major corporations all over the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note is the growing use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations defined as quantified environmental data for a product with pre set categories of parameters based on the ISO series of standards but not excluding additional environmental information . These third party certified LCA based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of competing products. Third party certification plays a major role in today s industry. Independent certification can show a company s dedication to safer and environmental friendlier products to customers and NGOs. citation needed LCA also has major roles in environmental impact assessment integrated waste management and pollution studies. A recent study evaluated the LCA of a laboratory scale plant for oxygen enriched air production coupled with its economic evaluation in an holistic eco design standpoint. LCA has also been used to assess the environmental impacts of pavement maintenance repair and rehabilitation activities. A life cycle analysis is only as valid as its data therefore it is crucial that data used for the completion of a life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another it is crucial that equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data. There are two basic types of LCA data unit process data and environmental input output data EIO where the latter is based on national economic input output data. Unit process data are derived from direct surveys of companies or plants producing the product of interest carried out at a unit process level defined by the system boundaries for the study. citation needed Data validity is an ongoing concern for life cycle analyses. Due to globalization and the rapid pace of research and development new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it both very important and very difficult to use up to date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA s conclusions are to be valid the data must be recent however the data gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA data was collected data validity is not a problem. However consumer electronics such as cell phones can be redesigned as often as every to months creating a need for ongoing data collection. citation needed The life cycle considered usually consists of a number of stages including materials extraction processing and manufacturing product use and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example the most energy intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight and thus car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost. citation needed Data sources are typically large databases. It is not appropriate to compare two options if different data sources have been used to source the data. Common data sources include Calculations for impact can then be done by hand but it is more usual to streamline the process by using software. This can range from a simple spreadsheet where the user enters the data manually to a fully automated program where the user is not aware of the source data. citation needed Cradle to grave is the full Life Cycle Assessment from resource extraction cradle to use phase and disposal phase grave . For example trees produce paper which can be recycled into low energy production cellulose fiberised paper insulation then used as an energy saving device in the ceiling of a home for years saving times the fossil fuel energy used in its production. After years the cellulose fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle. citation needed Cradle to gate is an assessment of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction cradle to the factory gate i.e. before it is transported to the consumer . The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle to gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations EPD termed business to business EPDs. One of the significant uses of the cradle to gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory LCI using cradle to gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle to gate values for their products. Cradle to cradle is a specific kind of cradle to grave assessment where the end of life disposal step for the product is a recycling process. It is a method used to minimize the environmental impact of products by employing sustainable production operation and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development. From the recycling process originate new identical products e.g. asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement glass bottles from collected glass bottles or different products e.g. glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles . citation needed Allocation of burden for products in open loop production systems presents considerable challenges for LCA. Various methods such as the avoided burden approach have been proposed to deal with the issues involved. citation needed Gate to gate is a partial LCA looking at only one value added process in the entire production chain. Gate to gate modules may also later be linked in their appropriate production chain to form a complete cradle to gate evaluation. Well to wheel is the specific LCA used for transport fuels and vehicles. The analysis is often broken down into stages entitled well to station or well to tank and station to wheel or tank to wheel or plug to wheel . The first stage which incorporates the feedstock or fuel production and processing and fuel delivery or energy transmission and is called the upstream stage while the stage that deals with vehicle operation itself is sometimes called the downstream stage. The well to wheel analysis is commonly used to assess total energy consumption or the energy conversion efficiency and emissions impact of marine vessels aircraft and motor vehicles including their carbon footprint and the fuels used in each of these transport modes. WtW analysis is useful for reflecting the different efficiencies and emissions of energy technologies and fuels at both the upstream and downstream stages giving a more complete picture of real emissions. The well to wheel variant has a significant input on a model developed by the Argonne National Laboratory. The Greenhouse gases Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation GREET model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well to wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle to grave approach is used to determine the impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use greenhouse gas emissions and six additional pollutants volatile organic compounds VOCs carbon monoxide CO nitrogen oxide NOx particulate matter with size smaller than micrometre PM particulate matter with size smaller than . micrometre PM. and sulfur oxides SOx . Quantitative values of greenhouse gas emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ since the LCA is considering more emission sources. In example while assessing the GHG emissions of a Battery Electric Vehicle in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle the WTW accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels finds out that an electric vehicle can save the of GHG while an hybrid LCA WTW method considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emission savings lower compared to the WTW. Economic input output LCA EIOLCA involves use of aggregate sector level data on how much environmental impact can be attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors. Such analysis can account for long chains for example building an automobile requires energy but producing energy requires vehicles and building those vehicles requires energy etc. which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA however EIOLCA relies on sector level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated. While a conventional LCA uses many of the same approaches and strategies as an Eco LCA the latter considers a much broader range of ecological impacts. It was designed to provide a guide to wise management of human activities by understanding the direct and indirect impacts on ecological resources and surrounding ecosystems. Developed by Ohio State University Center for resilience Eco LCA is a methodology that quantitatively takes into account regulating and supporting services during the life cycle of economic goods and products. In this approach services are categorized in four main groups supporting regulating provisioning and cultural services. Exergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Wall clearly states the relation between exergy analysis and resource accounting. This intuition confirmed by DeWulf and Sciubba lead to Exergo economic accounting and to methods specifically dedicated to LCA such as Exergetic material input per unit of service EMIPS . The concept of material input per unit of service MIPS is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service EMIPS has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported and the total distance but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. citation needed Life cycle energy analysis LCEA is an approach in which all energy inputs to a product are accounted for not only direct energy inputs during manufacture but also all energy inputs needed to produce components materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. An earlier term for the approach was energy analysis. citation needed With LCEA the total life cycle energy input is established. citation needed It is recognized that much energy is lost in the production of energy commodities themselves such as nuclear energy photovoltaic electricity or high quality petroleum products. Net energy content is the energy content of the product minus energy input used during extraction and conversion directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturing solar cells requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell citation needed . The result was refuted. Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is energy cannibalism. Energy cannibalism refers to an effect where rapid growth of an entire energy intensive industry creates a need for energy that uses or cannibalizes the energy of existing power plants. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the embodied energy of future power plants. Work has been undertaken in the UK to determine the life cycle energy alongside full LCA impacts of a number of renewable technologies. If materials are incinerated during the disposal process the energy released during burning can be harnessed and used for electricity production. This provides a low impact energy source especially when compared with coal and natural gas While incineration produces more greenhouse gas emissions than landfills the waste plants are well fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfills without energy recovery against incineration with energy recovery found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when landfill gas is recovered for electricity production. It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ and that it should not be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability. citation needed For example simple energy analysis does not take into account the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products . Incorporating Dynamic LCAs of renewable energy technologies using sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid may help mitigate this criticism. In recent years the literature on life cycle assessment of energy technology has begun to reflect the interactions between the current electrical grid and future energy technology. Some papers have focused on energy life cycle while others have focused on carbon dioxide CO and other greenhouse gases. The essential critique given by these sources is that when considering energy technology the growing nature of the power grid must be taken into consideration. If this is not done a given class of energy technology may emit more CO over its lifetime than it initially thought it would mitigate with this most well documented in wind energy s case. A problem the energy analysis method cannot resolve is that different energy forms heat electricity chemical energy etc. have different quality and value even in natural sciences as a consequence of the two main laws of thermodynamics. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is exergy. According to the first law of thermodynamics all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight whereas by the second law diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values. citation needed The conflict is resolved in one of these ways Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool for analyzing commensurable aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor however can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the boundary critique to systems thinking. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance data from generic processes may be based on averages unrepresentative sampling or outdated results. Additionally social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However because of aspects like differing system boundaries different statistical information different product uses etc. these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data. There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a lot of room for the researcher to decide what is important how the product is typically manufactured and how it is typically used. citation needed An in depth review of LCA studies of wood and paper products found a lack of consistency in the methods and assumptions used to track carbon during the product lifecycle. A wide variety of methods and assumptions were used leading to different and potentially contrary conclusions particularly with regard to carbon sequestration and methane generation in landfills and with carbon accounting during forest growth and product use. citation needed Media related to Life cycle assessment at Wikimedia Commons ",FALSE
"8",8,"Industrial symbiosis","/wiki/Industrial_symbiosis",TRUE,0,"subset|","Industrial Symbiosis a subset of industrial ecology"," Industrial Symbiosis a subset of industrial ecology. It describes how a network of diverse organizations can foster eco innovation and long term culture change create and share mutually profitable transactions and improve business and technical processes. Although geographic proximity is often associated with industrial symbiosis it is neither necessary nor sufficient nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange. Strategic planning is required to optiize the synergies of co location. In practice using industrial symbiosis as an approach to commercial operations using recovering and redirecting resources for reuse results in resources remaining in productive use in the economy for longer. This in turn creates business opportunities reduces demands on the earth s resources and provides a stepping stone towards creating a circular economy. The industrial symbiosis model devised and managed by International Synergies Limited is a facilitated model operating at the national scale in the United Kingdom NISP National Industrial Symbiosis Programme and at other scales around the world. International Synergies Limited has developed global expertise in IS instigating programmes in Belgium Brazil Canada China Denmark Finland Hungary Italy Mexico Poland Romania Slovakia South Africa and Turkey as well as the UK. Industrial symbiosis is a subset of industrial ecology with a particular focus on material and energy exchange. Industrial ecology is a relatively new field that is based on a natural paradigm claiming that an industrial ecosystem may behave in a similar way to the natural ecosystem wherein everything gets recycled albeit the simplicity and applicability of this paradigm has been questioned. Eco industrial development is one of the ways in which industrial ecology contributes to the integration of economic growth and environmental protection. Some of the examples of eco industrial development are This classification omits any industrial sector wide approaches and appreciates the diversity of the industrial system which is a key feature of industrial symbiosis. It is aimed to include initiatives that focus on achieving utility sharing and symbiosis among diverse sectors of industry . It is the diversity and the openness of industrial symbiosis that makes it a unique approach to eco industrial development. Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials energy water and or by products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity . Notably this definition and the stated key aspects of industrial symbiosis i.e. the role of collaboration and geographic proximity in its variety of forms has been explored and empirically tested in the UK through the research and published activities of the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme. Industrial symbiosis systems collectively optimize material and energy use at efficiencies beyond those achievable by any individual process alone. IS systems such as the web of materials and energy exchanges among companies in Kalundborg Denmark have spontaneously evolved from a series of micro innovations over a long time scale however the engineered design and implementation of such systems from a macro planner s perspective on a relatively short time scale proves challenging. Nevertheless there are examples of industrial symbiosis being approached as national regional initiatives with some significant success particularly in Europe. Often access to information on available by products is difficult to obtain. These by products are considered waste and typically not traded or listed on any type of exchange. Recent work reviewed government policies necessary to construct a multi gigaWatt photovoltaic factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of solar photovoltaic cells. The results of the analysis show that an eight factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium term investment by any government which will not only obtain direct financial return but also an improved global environment. This is because synergies have been identified for co locating glass manufacturing and photovoltaic manufacturing. The waste heat from glass manufacturing can be used in industrial sized greenhouses for food production. Even within the PV plant itself a secondary chemical recycling plant can reduce environmental impact while improving economic performance for the group of manufacturing facilities. In DCM Shriram consolidated limited Kota unit produces caustic soda calcium carbide cement and PVC resins.Chlorine and hydrogen are obtained as by products from caustic soda production while calcium carbide produced is partly sold and partly is treated with water to form slurry aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide and ethylene. The chlorine and ethylene produced are utilised to form PVC compounds while the slurry is consumed for cement production by wet process. Hydrochloric acid is prepared by direct synthesis where the pure chlorine gas can be combined with hydrogen to produce hydrogen chloride in the presence of UV light. ",FALSE

It means using the Earth s limited resources in a sustainable manner while minimising environmental impact. A report by The Carbon Trust suggested that resource challenges are intensifying rapidly for example there could be a gap between available water supplies and water needs by and some critical materials could be in short supply as soon as . needs update These challenges could lead to disruptions to supply growing regulatory requirements volatile fluctuation of prices and may ultimately threaten the viability of existing business models. Resource efficiency measures methods and aims are quite similar to those of resource productivity resource intensity and of the slightly more environment inclined concept of ecological efficiency eco efficiency. To achieve and optimize natural resource and energy efficiency several sustainable economical or production schemes have been proposed over the course of the last years when circular economy cradle to cradle or regenerative design as well as biomimetics principles just to name a few. Common to all of them is built in sustainability in which non renewable resource wasting is ruled out by design. They are generally built to be holistic robustly self sustaining and respecting the carrying capacity of the economic or ecological system. A key tool in resource efficiency is measuring different aspects of resource use e.g. carbon footprint water footprint land footprint or material use then identifying hot spots where the most resources are used or where there are the best opportunities to reduce this resource use. For example WRAP has published information on hotspots for grocery products likely to contribute most to the environmental impacts associated with UK household consumption. WRAP have created a range of tools and guides to help improve business resource efficiency. UNEP works to promote resource efficiency and sustainable consumption and production SCP in both developed and developing countries. The focus is on achieving increased understanding and implementation by public and private decision makers as well as civil society of policies and actions for resource efficiency and SCP. This includes the promotion of sustainable resource management in a life cycle perspective for goods and services. The resource efficient Europe flagship initiative is part of the Europe Strategy the EU s growth strategy for a smart inclusive and sustainable economy.

It should be distinguished from recycling which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products. Reuse by taking but not reprocessing previously used items helps save time money energy and resources. In broader economic terms it can make quality products available to people and organizations with limited means while generating jobs and business activity that contribute to the economy. Historically financial motivation was one of the main drivers of reuse. In the developing world this driver can lead to very high levels of reuse however rising wages and consequent consumer demand for the convenience of disposable products has made the reuse of low value items such as packaging uneconomic in richer countries leading to the demise of many reuse programs. Current environmental awareness is gradually changing attitudes and regulations such as the new packaging regulations are gradually beginning to reverse the situation. One example of conventional reuse is the doorstep delivery of milk in reuseable bottles other examples include the retreading of tires and the use of returnable reusable plastic boxes shipping containers instead of single use corrugated fiberboard boxes. Reuse has certain potential advantages Disadvantages are also apparent These services facilitate the transaction and redistribution of unwanted yet perfectly usable materials and equipment from one entity to another. The entities that benefit from either side of this service as donors sellers recipients or buyers can be businesses nonprofits schools community groups and individuals. Some maintain a physical space a reuse center and others act as a matching service a virtual exchange . Reuse centers generally maintain both warehouses and trucks. They take possession of the donated materials and make them available for redistribution or sale. Virtual exchanges do not have physical space or trucks but instead allow users to post listings of materials available and wanted for free or at low cost on an online materials exchange website. Staff will help facilitate the exchange of these materials without ever taking possession of the materials. Virtual exchanges include Consumer resources exist for exchanging usable materials such as freecycling sites which are often grassroots and entirely nonprofit movements of people who are giving and getting stuff for free in their own towns. It s all about reuse and keeping good stuff out of landfills. Membership is normally free. In addition there are directory based resources such as RecycleChicken.com which point consumers to local and national locations for reuse and repurposing of materials not normally accepted in recycling programs. With technological innovations new applications and shorter product lifetimes there is an ever increasing quantity of waste electrical and electronic equipment. The environmental pressures associated with this are well documented and include material and energy losses and an increase in air water and land pollution from waste treatment methods. The incorrect disposal and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment also poses threats to human health particularly when involving illegal exports. Virtual exchanges include One way to address this is to increase product longevity either by extending a product s first life or addressing issues of repair reuse and recycling. Reusing products and therefore extending the use of that item beyond the point where it is discarded by its first user is preferable to recycling or disposal as this is the least energy intensive solution although it is often overlooked. The EU Circular Economy Package recognises the importance of extending product lifetimes and includes repair and reuse of products in its action plan to ensure products reach their optimum lifespan. If targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are to be reached then reuse needs to be included as part of a whole life cycle approach. A strong second hand market place exists with charity shops on most high streets car boot trunk sales and online auction sites maintaining popularity and regular TV shows featuring both buying and selling at auction. However the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment products remains low due to inadequate infrastructure lack of repair networks and products. Local authority collection systems are better suited for handling waste than handling goods and preserving reuse potential. Retailer delivery staff are trained to handle goods carefully. So do we need a radical rethink on how we move unwanted still usable items to the second hand market place Is there a case for changing our approach to producer responsibility and insisting that producers finance collection for reuse and additionally drive consumer choices for reuse repair and remanufacture whilst addressing the costs of recycling and disposal There are opportunities for producers waste management companies and local authorities to make both repair and reuse habitual whilst these require changes to householder behaviour change through raising awareness they also require investment in infrastructure and logistical operations. Is it time to insist that more products are designed to have longer lifetimes That they can be disassembled repaired and reused before being recycled This would not necessarily be a poor strategy for businesses there are business models that provide opportunities to retain ownership of valuable products and components through leasing servicing repair and re sale. While it is choices made by consumers that will ultimately determine the success of such ventures there is huge potential for the reuse of goods and materials to deliver social and economic and environmental benefits. The EU Circular Economy Package the Scottish Circular Economy Strategy and the national reuse target set by the Spanish Government are examples of governments recognising that second hand goods should be a good value mainstream option and are working towards making reuse easier for consumers. In environmental terms reuse ought to be more common than recycling and energy recovery with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. If we are going to be serious about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled. The most involved reuse organizations are repair and overhaul industries which take valuable parts such as engine blocks office furniture toner cartridges single use cameras aircraft hulls and cathode ray tubes CRTs and refurbish them in a factory environment in order to meet the same similar specifications as new products. Xerox copy machines and Cummins Engine are examples of refurbishing factories in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China. citation needed Some factories operate in competition with the original equipment manufacturer OEM . When the refurbished item is resold under a new label used monitor CRTs made into TVs or cameras resold under a new label this has been found legal by most courts. citation needed When the item is resold under the same OEM name it is informally considered a gray market item if it is sold as used it s legal if it s represented as an OEM product eligible for rebates and warranties it is considered counterfeit or black market . citation needed The automobile parts industry in the USA is governed by laws on the disclosure of used parts and in some states mattresses which have been used are required to be sanitized or destroyed. Whether these laws are in place to protect consumers from black market items or to protect manufacturers hindsight obsolescence is often an area of intense debate. citation needed Fuji Photo Film Co. v. Jazz Photo Corp. is a recent example of the war between patent holders and refurbishing factories. To quote the District Court of New Jersey Thus the key issue in the dispute between Fuji and Jazz is whether the cameras sold by Jazz are refurbished in such a way that they can be considered to have been permissibly repaired or impermissibly reconstructed. Deposit programs offer customers a financial incentive to return packaging for reuse. Although no longer common international experience is showing that they can still be an effective way to encourage packaging reuse. citation needed However financial incentive unless great may be less of an incentive than convenience statistics show that on average a milk bottle is returned times whereas a lemonade bottle with a p deposit is returned on average only times. citation needed Refillable bottles are used extensively in many European countries for example in Denmark of bottles are refillable and of those are returned by consumers. These systems are typically supported by deposit laws and other regulations. Sainsbury Ltd have operated a plastic carrier bag cash refund scheme in the penny back scheme . The scheme is reported to save tonnes of plastic per annum. The scheme has now been extended to a penny back on a voucher which can be contributed to schools registered on the scheme it estimates this will raise the savings in plastic to tonnes per annum. In some developing nations like India and Pakistan the cost of new bottles often forces manufacturers to collect and refill old glass bottles for selling cola and other drinks. India and Pakistan also have a way of reusing old newspapers Kabadiwalas buy these from the readers for scrap value and reuse them as packaging or recycle them. Scrap intermediaries help consumer dispose of other materials including metals and plastics. citation needed These apply primarily to items of packaging for example where a company is involved in the regular transportation of goods from a central manufacturing facility to warehouses or warehouses to retail outlets. In these cases there is considerable benefit to using reusable transport packaging such as plastic crates or pallets. The benefits of closed loop reuse are primarily due to low additional transport costs being involved the empty lorry returning with the empty crates. There have been some recent attempts to get the public to join in on closed loop reuse schemes where shoppers use reusable plastic baskets in place of carrier bags for transporting their goods home from the supermarket these baskets fit on specially designed trolleys making shopping supposedly easier. There have been some market led initiatives to encourage packaging reuse by companies introducing refill packs of certain commodities mainly soap powders and cleaning fluids the contents being transferred before use into a reusable package kept by the customer with the savings in packaging being passed onto the customer by lower shelf prices. The refill pack itself is not reused but being a minimal package for carrying the product home it requires less material than one with the durability and features reclosable top convenient shape etc. required for easy use of the product while avoiding the transport cost and emissions of returning the reusable package to the factory. Some items such as clothes and children s toys often become unwanted before they wear out due to changes in their owner s needs or preferences these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family friends or neighbours through environmental freecycling organisations or through anti poverty charities such as the Red Cross United Way Salvation Army and Goodwill which give these items to those who could not afford them new. Other organizations such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America s school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American for example throws away . pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately million people that translates into billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact whose members promise not to buy anything new for a year and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces landfill inline with the waste minimization program but can help raise money for a good cause. Printer ink cartridges can be reused. They are sorted by brand and model to be refilled or resold back to the manufacturers. The companies then refill the ink reservoir to resell to consumers. Toner cartridges are recycled the same way as ink cartridges using toner instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges. Repurposing is to use a tool for use as another tool usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool maker. Typically repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk or garbage. A good example of this would be the Earthship style of house that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose. Examples of repurposing include using tires as boat fenders and steel drums or plastic drums as feeding troughs and or composting bins. A waste exchange or virtual exchange facilitates the use of a waste product from one process as a raw material for another. As with new life reuse of finished items this avoids the environmental costs of disposing of the waste and obtaining new raw material and may still be possible if the nature of the process makes avoiding production of the waste or recycling it back into the original process impossible. This sort of scheme needs to have a far broader base than is currently the case it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a waste but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market c.f waste cement kiln dust and N viro lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer . In the former East Germany organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state s control of agriculture the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued. citation needed The nutrients i.e. nitrogen phosphorus potassium and micronutrients and organic matter contained in wastewater excreta urine and feces and greywater have traditionally been reused in agriculture in many countries and are still being reused in agriculture to this day unfortunately often in an unregulated and unsafe manner. This is particularly a problem in many developing countries e.g. Mexico India Bangladesh Ghana where untreated or poorly treated wastewater is used directly in agriculture. The WHO Guidelines from have set up a framework how this reuse can be done safely by following a multiple barrier approach. Work by the International Water Management Institute has led to a better understanding on how such wastewater reuse can be safely implemented in practice for which they won the Stockholm Water Prize in . Reuse of sanitised excreta in agriculture has also been called a closing the loop approach for sanitation and agriculture and is central to the ecological sanitation approach. Determining the balance of how the several effects of reuse interact is often best accomplished by a formal life cycle assessment. For example research has shown that reusing a product can reduce CO emissions and carbon footprint by more than relative to the complete product life cycle. A relatively unknown effective way to reduce CO emissions and carbon footprint is reusing products. Often the relative carbon footprint of manufacturing and the supply chain is unknown. A scientific methodology has been developed to calculate how much CO emissions are reduced when buying used or second hand hardware versus new hardware the so called durability greener network calculator. citation needed There are many ways of measuring the positive environmental economic and social impact data. These include A Pigovian tax is an environmental tax a charge on items that reflects the environmental costs of their manufacture and disposal. This makes the environmental benefit of using one reusable item instead of many disposable ones into a financial incentive. Such charges have been introduced in some countries. specify citation needed Recycling differs from reuse in that it breaks down the item into raw materials which are then used to make new items as opposed to reusing the intact item. As this extra processing requires energy as a rule of thumb reuse is environmentally preferable to recycling reduce reuse recycle though recycling does have a significant part to play as it can often make use of items which are broken worn out or otherwise unsuitable for reuse. However as transport emissions are significant portion of the environmental impact of both reuse and recycling in some cases recycling is the more prudent course as reuse can require long transport distances. A complex life cycle analysis may be required during a product s design phase to determine the efficacy of reuse recycling or neither and produce accordingly. Besides physical resources information is often reused notably program code for the software that drives computers and the Internet but also the documentation that explains how to use every modern device. And it is proposed as a way to improve education by assembling a great library of shareable learning objects that can be reused in learning management systems. Software reuse grew out of the standard subroutine libraries of the s. citation needed It is the main principle of today s object oriented programming. citation needed Instead of constantly reinventing software wheels programming languages like C Java Objective C and others are building vast collections of reusable software objects and components.Template Https natureofgeography.blogspot.com the three R principle.html Reuse of information has a tremendous return on investment for organizations whose documentation is translated into many languages. Translation memory systems can store text that has already been translated into dozens of languages for retrieval and reuse. Reuse of older software is popular among retrocomputing. Most of the time emulators are used to run older software from other platforms or other operating systems. Sometimes older operating systems such as DOS are reused for computing roles that don t demand lots of computing power. However the widespread of availability of secondhand Windows XP computers at extreme low prices has largely supplanted immediate opportunities for using DOS on some repurposing applications especially since something like USB isn t found on most pre Windows XP computers.",FALSE
"11",11,"waste","/wiki/Waste",TRUE,0,"material|material|waste|","Waste or wastes are unwanted or unusable materials"," Waste or wastes are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use or is worthless defective and of no use. A by product by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value. A waste product may become a by product joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product s value above zero. Examples include municipal solid waste household trash refuse hazardous waste wastewater such as sewage which contains bodily wastes feces and urine and surface runoff radioactive waste and others. According to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of Art. Wastes are substance or objects which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law . The UNSD Glossary of Environment Statistics describes waste as materials that are not prime products that is products produced for the market for which the generator has no further use in terms of his her own purposes of production transformation or consumption and of which he she wants to dispose. Wastes may be generated during the extraction of raw materials the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products the consumption of final products and other human activities. Residuals recycled or reused at the place of generation are excluded. Under the Waste Framework Directive EC Art. the European Union defines waste as an object the holder discards intends to discard or is required to discard. For a more structural description of the Waste Directive see the European Commission s summary. There are many waste types defined by modern systems of waste management notably including There are many issues that surround reporting waste. It is most commonly measured by size or weight and there is a stark difference between the two. For example organic waste is much heavier when it is wet and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size. On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into waste categories as well as different ways of reporting. Based on incomplete reports from its parties the Basel Convention estimated million tonnes of waste was generated in . For the same year OECD estimated billion tonnes from its member countries. Despite these inconsistencies waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations and to find ways of preventing minimizing recovering treating and disposing waste.  Inappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects which can harbour gastrointestinal parasites yellow fever worms the plague and other conditions for humans and exposure to hazardous wastes particularly when they are burned can cause various other diseases including cancers. Toxic waste materials can contaminate surface water groundwater soil and air which causes more problems for humans other species and ecosystems. Waste treatment and disposal produces significant green house gas GHG emissions notably methane which are contributing significantly to global warming. Waste management is a significant environmental justice issue. Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups such as racial minorities women and residents of developing nations. NIMBY not in my back yard is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development because it is close to them. However the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide. There is now a growing market in the transboundary movement of waste and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations a significant amount of waste is moved from developed to developing nations. The economic costs of managing waste are high and are often paid for by municipal governments money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes modifying vehicles and with public education. Environmental policies such as pay as you throw can reduce the cost of management and reduce waste quantities. Waste recovery that is recycling reuse can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs. Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems case studies using a combination of life cycle assessment LCA and life cycle costing LCC . The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise dust pollution unsightliness and negative stigma. The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals glass plastic textiles and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system but other negative economic effects come with the disease poverty exploitation and abuse of its workers. Resource recovery is the retrieval of recyclable waste which was intended for disposal for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources or convert to energy. This process is carried out at a resource recovery facility. Resource recovery is not only important to the environment but it can be cost effective by decreasing the amount of waste sent to the disposal stream reduce the amount of space needed for landfills and protect limited natural resources. Energy recovery from waste is using non recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat electricity or energy through a variety of processes including combustion gasification pyrolyzation and anaerobic digestion. This process is referred to as waste to energy. There are several ways to recover energy from waste. Anaerobic digestion is a naturally occurring process of decomposition where organic matter is reduced to a simpler chemical component in the absence of oxygen. Incineration or direct controlled burning of municipal solid waste to reduce waste and make energy. Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities. Pyrolysis involves heating of waste with the absence of oxygen to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and solid residue. Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream. Plasma arc heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from C where energy is released by an electrical discharge in an inert atmosphere. Using waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits. It can provide a safe and cost effective option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt with through disposal. It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels while also generating energy and using waste as fuel can reduce the methane emissions generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills. There is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes. Crude Tall Oil CTO a co product of the pulp and papermaking process is defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced on purpose and has significant value add potential in industrial applications. Several companies use CTO to produce fuel while the pine chemicals industry maximizes it as a feedstock producing low carbon bio based chemicals through cascading use. Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation and the depletion of natural resources. Local regional and global air pollution accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes destruction and depletion of forests soil and water depletion of the ozone layer and emission of green house gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity the security of nations and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and waste management programs e.g. the waste management university project. University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations e.g. WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management.

"12",12,"anaerobic digestion","/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion",TRUE,0,"material|material|process|","Anaerobic digestion is a collection of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen","Anaerobic digestion is a collection of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to manage waste or to produce fuels. Much of the fermentation used industrially to produce food and drink products as well as home fermentation uses anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion occurs naturally in some soils and in lake and oceanic basin sediments where it is usually referred to as anaerobic activity . This is the source of marsh gas methane as discovered by Alessandro Volta in . The digestion process begins with bacterial hydrolysis of the input materials. Insoluble organic polymers such as carbohydrates are broken down to soluble derivatives that become available for other bacteria. Acidogenic bacteria then convert the sugars and amino acids into carbon dioxide hydrogen ammonia and organic acids. These bacteria convert these resulting organic acids into acetic acid along with additional ammonia hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Finally methanogens convert these products to methane and carbon dioxide. The methanogenic archaea populations play an indispensable role in anaerobic wastewater treatments. Anaerobic digestion is used as part of the process to treat biodegradable waste and sewage sludge. As part of an integrated waste management system anaerobic digestion reduces the emission of landfill gas into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with purpose grown energy crops such as maize. Anaerobic digestion is widely used as a source of renewable energy. The process produces a biogas consisting of methane carbon dioxide and traces of other contaminant gases. This biogas can be used directly as fuel in combined heat and power gas engines or upgraded to natural gas quality biomethane. The nutrient rich digestate also produced can be used as fertilizer. With the re use of waste as a resource and new technological approaches that have lowered capital costs anaerobic digestion has in recent years received increased attention among governments in a number of countries among these the United Kingdom Germany and Denmark . Many microorganisms affect anaerobic digestion including acetic acid forming bacteria acetogens and methane forming archaea methanogens . These organisms promote a number of chemical processes in converting the biomass to biogas. Gaseous oxygen is excluded from the reactions by physical containment. Anaerobes utilize electron acceptors from sources other than oxygen gas. These acceptors can be the organic material itself or may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself the intermediate end products are primarily alcohols aldehydes and organic acids plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens the intermediates are converted to the final end products of methane carbon dioxide and trace levels of hydrogen sulfide. In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane. Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. Therefore common practice is to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations a process known as seeding the digesters typically accomplished with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry. The four key stages of anaerobic digestion involve hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis. The overall process can be described by the chemical reaction where organic material such as glucose is biochemically digested into carbon dioxide CO and methane CH by the anaerobic microorganisms. CHO CO CH In most cases biomass is made up of large organic polymers. For the bacteria in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts. These constituent parts or monomers such as sugars are readily available to other bacteria. The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis. Therefore hydrolysis of these high molecular weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion. Through hydrolysis the complex organic molecules are broken down into simple sugars amino acids and fatty acids. Acetate and hydrogen produced in the first stages can be used directly by methanogens. Other molecules such as volatile fatty acids VFAs with a chain length greater than that of acetate must first be catabolised into compounds that can be directly used by methanogens. The biological process of acidogenesis results in further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic fermentative bacteria. Here VFAs are created along with ammonia carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide as well as other byproducts. The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way milk sours. The third stage of anaerobic digestion is acetogenesis. Here simple molecules created through the acidogenesis phase are further digested by acetogens to produce largely acetic acid as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The terminal stage of anaerobic digestion is the biological process of methanogenesis. Here methanogens use the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane carbon dioxide and water. These components make up the majority of the biogas emitted from the system. Methanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH . and pH . The remaining indigestible material the microbes cannot use and any dead bacterial remains constitute the digestate.  Anaerobic digesters can be designed and engineered to operate using a number of different configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions high vs. low portion of solids and single stage vs. multistage processes. Continuous process requires more complex design but still it may be more economical than batch process because batch process requires more initial building money and a larger volume of the digesters spread across several batches to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is required in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system but the thermophilic system requires much less time and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content so one has to consider that trade off carefully. For solids content low will handle up to solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases. Anaerobic digestion can be performed as a batch process or a continuous process. In a batch system biomass is added to the reactor at the start of the process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs inoculation with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a batch reactor is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with in vessel composting. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for in vessel composting before it is opened As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. Using more than one batch reactor at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas. In continuous digestion processes organic matter is constantly added continuous complete mixed or added in stages to the reactor continuous plug flow first in first out . Here the end products are constantly or periodically removed resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include continuous stirred tank reactors upflow anaerobic sludge blankets expanded granular sludge beds and internal circulation reactors. The two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters determine the species of methanogens in the digesters A limit case has been reached in Bolivia with anaerobic digestion in temperature working conditions of less than C. The anaerobic process is very slow taking more than three times the normal mesophilic time process. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks a litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from mud from a frozen lake in Alaska has produced litres of methane per day about to of the output from digesters in warmer climates. Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are therefore considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable their energy input is higher with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation such as the Animal By Products Regulations in the European Union requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of mesophilic. Additional pre treatment can be used to reduce the necessary retention time to produce biogas. For example certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage such as pasteurisation to significantly enhance the biogas output. The pasteurisation process can also be used to reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic digester. Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with maceration of the solids. In a typical scenario three different operational parameters are associated with the solids content of the feedstock to the digesters High solids dry digesters are designed to process materials with a solids content between and . Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries high solids dry stackable substrate digesters are designed to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed into the top of the digester and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters the feedstock is deposited in tunnel like chambers with a gas tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment such as contaminant removal depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the digestate. Size reduction grinding is beneficial in continuous vertical systems as it accelerates digestion while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure e.g. yard waste to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high solids content with a total suspended solids TSS concentration greater than or a low solids concentration less than . High solids wet digesters process a thick slurry that requires more energy input to move and process the feedstock. The thickness of the material may also lead to associated problems with abrasion. High solids digesters will typically have a lower land requirement due to the lower volumes associated with the moisture. citation needed High solids digesters also require correction of conventional performance calculations e.g. gas production retention time kinetics etc. originally based on very dilute sewage digestion concepts since larger fractions of the feedstock mass are potentially convertible to biogas. Low solids wet digesters can transport material through the system using standard pumps that require significantly lower energy input. Low solids digesters require a larger amount of land than high solids due to the increased volumes associated with the increased liquid to feedstock ratio of the digesters. There are benefits associated with operation in a liquid environment as it enables more thorough circulation of materials and contact between the bacteria and their food. This enables the bacteria to more readily access the substances on which they are feeding and increases the rate of gas production. citation needed Digestion systems can be configured with different levels of complexity. In a single stage digestion system one stage all of the biological reactions occur within a single sealed reactor or holding tank. Using a single stage reduces construction costs but results in less control of the reactions occurring within the system. Acidogenic bacteria through the production of acids reduce the pH of the tank. Methanogenic bacteria as outlined earlier operate in a strictly defined pH range. Therefore the biological reactions of the different species in a single stage reactor can be in direct competition with each other. Another one stage reaction system is an anaerobic lagoon. These lagoons are pond like earthen basins used for the treatment and long term storage of manures. Here the anaerobic reactions are contained within the natural anaerobic sludge contained in the pool. In a two stage digestion system multistage different digestion vessels are optimised to bring maximum control over the bacterial communities living within the digesters. Acidogenic bacteria produce organic acids and more quickly grow and reproduce than methanogenic bacteria. Methanogenic bacteria require stable pH and temperature to optimise their performance. Under typical circumstances hydrolysis acetogenesis and acidogenesis occur within the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature either mesophilic or thermophilic prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to the rate at which feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste. In this instance there may be a pasteurisation or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably it is not possible to completely isolate the different reaction phases and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks. The residence time in a digester varies with the amount and type of feed material and with the configuration of the digestion system. In a typical two stage mesophilic digestion residence time varies between and days while for a single stage thermophilic digestion residence times is normally faster and takes around days. The plug flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour. citation needed In the case of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion UASB hydraulic residence times can be as short as hour to day and solid retention times can be up to days. In this manner a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic retention times with the use of a sludge blanket. Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices depending on the level of solids in the material to mix the contents enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow excess material to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks. citation needed The anaerobic digestion process can be inhibited by several compounds affecting one or more of the bacterial groups responsible for the different organic matter degradation steps. The degree of the inhibition depends among other factors on the concentration of the inhibitor in the digester. Potential inhibitors are ammonia sulfide light metal ions Na K Mg Ca Al heavy metals some organics chlorophenols halogenated aliphatics N substituted aromatics long chain fatty acids etc. The most important initial issue when considering the application of anaerobic digestion systems is the feedstock to the process. Almost any organic material can be processed with anaerobic digestion however if biogas production is the aim the level of putrescibility is the key factor in its successful application. The more putrescible digestible the material the higher the gas yields possible from the system. Feedstocks can include biodegradable waste materials such as waste paper grass clippings leftover food sewage and animal waste. Woody wastes are the exception because they are largely unaffected by digestion as most anaerobes are unable to degrade lignin. Xylophalgeous anaerobes lignin consumers or using high temperature pretreatment such as pyrolysis can be used to break lignin down. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with specially grown energy crops such as silage for dedicated biogas production. In Germany and continental Europe these facilities are referred to as biogas plants. A codigestion or cofermentation plant is typically an agricultural anaerobic digester that accepts two or more input materials for simultaneous digestion. The length of time required for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily digestible sugars breaks down quickly whereas intact lignocellulosic material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to break down. Anaerobic microorganisms are generally unable to break down lignin the recalcitrant aromatic component of biomass. Anaerobic digesters were originally designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not however the material with the most potential for anaerobic digestion as the biodegradable material has already had much of the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore many digesters operate with codigestion of two or more types of feedstock. For example in a farm based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock e.g. grass and corn typical on farm feedstock or various organic byproducts such as slaughterhouse waste fats oils and grease from restaurants organic household waste etc. typical off site feedstock . Digesters processing dedicated energy crops can achieve high levels of degradation and biogas production. Slurry only systems are generally cheaper but generate far less energy than those using crops such as maize and grass silage by using a modest amount of crop material an anaerobic digestion plant can increase energy output tenfold for only three times the capital cost relative to a slurry only system. A second consideration related to the feedstock is moisture content. Drier stackable substrates such as food and yard waste are suitable for digestion in tunnel like chambers. Tunnel style systems typically have near zero wastewater discharge as well so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material the more suitable it will be to handling with standard pumps instead of energy intensive concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also the wetter the material the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks bulking agents such as compost should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow the optimal C N ratio is . Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion. The level of contamination of the feedstock material is a key consideration. If the feedstock to the digesters has significant levels of physical contaminants such as plastic glass or metals then processing to remove the contaminants will be required for the material to be used. If it is not removed then the digesters can be blocked and will not function efficiently. It is with this understanding that mechanical biological treatment plants are designed. The higher the level of pretreatment a feedstock requires the more processing machinery will be required and hence the project will have higher capital costs. After sorting or screening to remove any physical contaminants from the feedstock the material is often shredded minced and mechanically or hydraulically pulped to increase the surface area available to microbes in the digesters and hence increase the speed of digestion. The maceration of solids can be achieved by using a chopper pump to transfer the feedstock material into the airtight digester where anaerobic treatment takes place. Substrate composition is a major factor in determining the methane yield and methane production rates from the digestion of biomass. Techniques to determine the compositional characteristics of the feedstock are available while parameters such as solids elemental and organic analyses are important for digester design and operation. Methane yield can be estimated from the elemental composition of substrate along with an estimate of its degradability the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor . In order to predict biogas composition the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide it is necessary to estimate carbon dioxide partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases which requires additional information reactor temperature pH and substrate composition and a chemical speciation model. Direct measurements of biomethanation potential are also made using gas evolution or more recent gravimetric assays. Using anaerobic digestion technologies can help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in a number of key ways Anaerobic digestion is particularly suited to organic material and is commonly used for industrial effluent wastewater and sewage sludge treatment. Anaerobic digestion a simple process can greatly reduce the amount of organic matter which might otherwise be destined to be dumped at sea dumped in landfills or burnt in incinerators. Pressure from environmentally related legislation on solid waste disposal methods in developed countries has increased the application of anaerobic digestion as a process for reducing waste volumes and generating useful byproducts. It may either be used to process the source separated fraction of municipal waste or alternatively combined with mechanical sorting systems to process residual mixed municipal waste. These facilities are called mechanical biological treatment plants. If the putrescible waste processed in anaerobic digesters were disposed of in a landfill it would break down naturally and often anaerobically. In this case the gas will eventually escape into the atmosphere. As methane is about times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide this has significant negative environmental effects. In countries that collect household waste the use of local anaerobic digestion facilities can help to reduce the amount of waste that requires transportation to centralized landfill sites or incineration facilities. This reduced burden on transportation reduces carbon emissions from the collection vehicles. If localized anaerobic digestion facilities are embedded within an electrical distribution network they can help reduce the electrical losses associated with transporting electricity over a national grid. In developing countries simple home and farm based anaerobic digestion systems offer the potential for low cost energy for cooking and lighting. From China and India have both had large government backed schemes for adaptation of small biogas plants for use in the household for cooking and lighting. At present projects for anaerobic digestion in the developing world can gain financial support through the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism if they are able to show they provide reduced carbon emissions. Methane and power produced in anaerobic digestion facilities can be used to replace energy derived from fossil fuels and hence reduce emissions of greenhouse gases because the carbon in biodegradable material is part of a carbon cycle. The carbon released into the atmosphere from the combustion of biogas has been removed by plants for them to grow in the recent past usually within the last decade but more typically within the last growing season. If the plants are regrown taking the carbon out of the atmosphere once more the system will be carbon neutral. In contrast carbon in fossil fuels has been sequestered in the earth for many millions of years the combustion of which increases the overall levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Biogas from sewage sludge treatment is sometimes used to run a gas engine to produce electrical power some or all of which can be used to run the sewage works. Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is in general enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited in the UK there are about MW total of such generation with the potential to increase to MW which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter energy crops food waste abattoir waste etc. is much higher estimated to be capable of about MW. citation needed Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO emissions and strengthen the grid while providing UK farmers with additional revenues. Some countries offer incentives in the form of for example feed in tariffs for feeding electricity onto the power grid to subsidize green energy production. In Oakland California at the East Bay Municipal Utility District s main wastewater treatment plant EBMUD food waste is currently codigested with primary and secondary municipal wastewater solids and other high strength wastes. Compared to municipal wastewater solids digestion alone food waste codigestion has many benefits. Anaerobic digestion of food waste pulp from the EBMUD food waste process provides a higher normalized energy benefit compared to municipal wastewater solids to kWh per dry ton of food waste applied compared to to kWh per dry ton of municipal wastewater solids applied. Biogas grid injection is the injection of biogas into the natural gas grid. The raw biogas has to be previously upgraded to biomethane. This upgrading implies the removal of contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide or siloxanes as well as the carbon dioxide. Several technologies are available for this purpose the most widely implemented being pressure swing adsorption PSA water or amine scrubbing absorption processes and in recent years membrane separation. As an alternative the electricity and the heat can be used for on site generation resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy. Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from whereas the current energy losses on a large electrical system range from . In October Didcot Sewage Works became the first in the UK to produce biomethane gas supplied to the national grid for use in up to homes in Oxfordshire. By UK electricity firm Ecotricity plan to have digester fed by locally sourced grass fueling homes After upgrading with the above mentioned technologies the biogas transformed into biomethane can be used as vehicle fuel in adapted vehicles. This use is very extensive in Sweden where over gas vehicles exist and of the vehicle gas is biomethane generated in anaerobic digestion plants. The solid fibrous component of the digested material can be used as a soil conditioner to increase the organic content of soils. Digester liquor can be used as a fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is therefore more carbon intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as Spain where many soils are organically depleted the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas. By using a bio digester which produces the bacteria required for decomposing cooking gas is generated. The organic garbage like fallen leaves kitchen waste food waste etc. are fed into a crusher unit where the mixture is conflated with a small amount of water. The mixture is then fed into the bio digester where the bacteria decomposes it to produce cooking gas. This gas is piped to kitchen stove. A cubic meter bio digester can produce cubic meter of cooking gas. This is equivalent to kg of LPG. The notable advantage of using a bio digester is the sludge which is a rich organic manure. The three principal products of anaerobic digestion are biogas digestate and water. Biogas is the ultimate waste product of the bacteria feeding off the input biodegradable feedstock the methanogenesis stage of anaerobic digestion is performed by archaea a micro organism on a distinctly different branch of the phylogenetic tree of life to bacteria and is mostly methane and carbon dioxide with a small amount hydrogen and trace hydrogen sulfide. As produced biogas also contains water vapor with the fractional water vapor volume a function of biogas temperature . Most of the biogas is produced during the middle of the digestion after the bacterial population has grown and tapers off as the putrescible material is exhausted. The gas is normally stored on top of the digester in an inflatable gas bubble or extracted and stored next to the facility in a gas holder. The methane in biogas can be burned to produce both heat and electricity usually with a reciprocating engine or microturbine often in a cogeneration arrangement where the electricity and waste heat generated are used to warm the digesters or to heat buildings. Excess electricity can be sold to suppliers or put into the local grid. Electricity produced by anaerobic digesters is considered to be renewable energy and may attract subsidies. Biogas does not contribute to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations because the gas is not released directly into the atmosphere and the carbon dioxide comes from an organic source with a short carbon cycle. Biogas may require treatment or scrubbing to refine it for use as a fuel. Hydrogen sulfide a toxic product formed from sulfates in the feedstock is released as a trace component of the biogas. National environmental enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the English and Welsh Environment Agency put strict limits on the levels of gases containing hydrogen sulfide and if the levels of hydrogen sulfide in the gas are high gas scrubbing and cleaning equipment such as amine gas treating will be needed to process the biogas to within regionally accepted levels. Alternatively the addition of ferrous chloride FeCl to the digestion tanks inhibits hydrogen sulfide production. Volatile siloxanes can also contaminate the biogas such compounds are frequently found in household waste and wastewater. In digestion facilities accepting these materials as a component of the feedstock low molecular weight siloxanes volatilise into biogas. When this gas is combusted in a gas engine turbine or boiler siloxanes are converted into silicon dioxide SiO which deposits internally in the machine increasing wear and tear. Practical and cost effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available at the present time. In certain applications in situ treatment can be used to increase the methane purity by reducing the offgas carbon dioxide content purging the majority of it in a secondary reactor. In countries such as Switzerland Germany and Sweden the methane in the biogas may be compressed for it to be used as a vehicle transportation fuel or input directly into the gas mains. In countries where the driver for the use of anaerobic digestion are renewable electricity subsidies this route of treatment is less likely as energy is required in this processing stage and reduces the overall levels available to sell. Digestate is the solid remnants of the original input material to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. Digestate can come in three forms fibrous liquor or a sludge based combination of the two fractions. In two stage systems different forms of digestate come from different digestion tanks. In single stage digestion systems the two fractions will be combined and if desired separated by further processing. The second byproduct acidogenic digestate is a stable organic material consisting largely of lignin and cellulose but also of a variety of mineral components in a matrix of dead bacterial cells some plastic may be present. The material resembles domestic compost and can be used as such or to make low grade building products such as fibreboard. The solid digestate can also be used as feedstock for ethanol production. The third byproduct is a liquid methanogenic digestate rich in nutrients which can be used as a fertiliser depending on the quality of the material being digested. Levels of potentially toxic elements PTEs should be chemically assessed. This will depend upon the quality of the original feedstock. In the case of most clean and source separated biodegradable waste streams the levels of PTEs will be low. In the case of wastes originating from industry the levels of PTEs may be higher and will need to be taken into consideration when determining a suitable end use for the material. Digestate typically contains elements such as lignin that cannot be broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also the digestate may contain ammonia that is phytotoxic and may hamper the growth of plants if it is used as a soil improving material. For these two reasons a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms such as fungi helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil improver. Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies. The final output from anaerobic digestion systems is water which originates both from the moisture content of the original waste that was treated and water produced during the microbial reactions in the digestion systems. This water may be released from the dewatering of the digestate or may be implicitly separate from the digestate. The wastewater exiting the anaerobic digestion facility will typically have elevated levels of biochemical oxygen demand BOD and chemical oxygen demand COD . These measures of the reactivity of the effluent indicate an ability to pollute. Some of this material is termed hard COD meaning it cannot be accessed by the anaerobic bacteria for conversion into biogas. If this effluent were put directly into watercourses it would negatively affect them by causing eutrophication. As such further treatment of the wastewater is often required. This treatment will typically be an oxidation stage wherein air is passed through the water in a sequencing batch reactors or reverse osmosis unit. The history of anaerobic digestion is a long one beginning as early as tenth century BCE in Assyria where biogas was used to heat bath water. Reported scientific interest in the manufacturing of gas produced by the natural decomposition of organic matter dates from the th century when Robert Boyle and Stephen Hales noted that disturbing the sediment of streams and lakes released flammable gas. In the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta the father of Electrochemistry scientifically identified that gas as methane. In Sir Humphry Davy proved the presence of methane in the gases produced by cattle manure. The first known anaerobic digester was built in at a leper colony in Bombay in India. In the technology was developed in Exeter England where a septic tank was used to generate gas for the sewer gas destructor lamp a type of gas lighting. Also in England in the first dual purpose tank for both sedimentation and sludge treatment was installed in Hampton London. By the early th century anaerobic digestion systems began to resemble the technology as it appears today. In Karl Imhoff created the Imhoff tank an early form of anaerobic digester and model wastewater treatment system throughout the early th century. After closed tank systems began to replace the previously common use of anaerobic lagoons covered earthen basins used to treat volatile solids. Research on anaerobic digestion began in earnest in the s. Around the time of World War I production from biofuels slowed as petroleum production increased and its uses were identified. While fuel shortages during World War II re popularized anaerobic digestion interest in the technology decreased again after the war ended. Similarly the s energy crisis sparked interest in anaerobic digestion. In addition to high energy prices factors affecting the adoption of Anaerobic Digestion systems include receptivity to innovation pollution penalties policy incentives and the availability of subsidies and funding opportunities. Today anaerobic digesters are commonly found alongside farms to reduce nitrogen run off from manure or wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the costs of sludge disposal. Agricultural anaerobic digestion for energy production has become most popular in Germany where there were digesters in . In the United Kingdom there were facilities by and projects planned to become operational by . In the United States there were operational plants across states in . Policy may explain why adoption rates are so different across these countries. Feed in tariffs in Germany were enacted in also known as FIT providing long term contracts compensating investments in renewable energy generation. Consequently between and the number of anaerobic digester plants in Germany grew from to . In the late s energy prices in Germany varied and investors became unsure of the market s potential. The German government responded by amending FIT four times between and increasing tariffs and improving the profitability of anaerobic digestion and resulting in reliable returns for biogas production and continued high adoption rates across the country.

"13",13,"biogas","/wiki/Biogas",TRUE,0,"matter|","Biogas is the mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen"," Biogas is the mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste manure municipal waste plant material sewage green waste or food waste. Biogas is a renewable energy source. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with methanogen or anaerobic organisms which digest material inside a closed system or fermentation of biodegradable materials. This closed system is called an anaerobic digester biodigester or a bioreactor. Biogas is primarily methane CH and carbon dioxide CO and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide HS moisture and siloxanes. The gases methane hydrogen and carbon monoxide CO can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen. This energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel it can be used for any heating purpose such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat. Biogas can be compressed the same way as natural gas is compressed to CNG and used to power motor vehicles. In the United Kingdom for example biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around of vehicle fuel. It qualifies for renewable energy subsidies in some parts of the world. Biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards when it becomes bio methane. Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production and use cycle is continuous and it generates no net carbon dioxide. As the organic material grows it is converted and used. It then regrows in a continually repeating cycle. From a carbon perspective as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio resource as is released when the material is ultimately converted to energy. The biogas is a renewable energy that can be used for heating electricity and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine such as GE Jenbacher or Caterpillar gas engines. To provide these internal combustion engines with biogas having ample gas pressure to optimize combustion within the European Union ATEX centrifugal fan units built in accordance with the European directive EU previously EG are obligatory. These centrifugal fan units for example Combimac Meidinger AG or Witt Sohn AG are suitable for use in Zone and . Other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat. The digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas. It can be used as an agricultural fertiliser. Biogas is produced either Projects such as NANOCLEAN are nowadays developing new ways to produce biogas more efficiently using iron oxide nanoparticles in the processes of organic waste treatment. This process can triple the production of biogas. A biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes or energy crops. It can be produced using anaerobic digesters air tight tanks with different configurations . These plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste. During the process the micro organisms transform biomass waste into biogas mainly methane and carbon dioxide and digestate. Higher quantity of biogas could be produced when the wastewater is co fermented with other residual from dairy industry sugar industry brewery industry. For example while mixing of wastewater from beer factory with cow whey the production of biogas is increased by . times compared to the biogas produced by wastewater from beer factory only. There are two key processes mesophilic and thermophilic digestion which is dependent on temperature. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks a litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from mud from a frozen lake in Alaska has produced liters of methane per day about of the output from digesters in warmer climates. The air pollution produced by biogas is similar to that of natural gas. The content of toxic hydrogen sulfide presents additional risks and has been responsible for serious accidents. Leaks of unburned methane are an additional risk because methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Biogas can be explosive when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to parts air. Special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work. It is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion. Negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked Because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water measured by a pressure gauge. Frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system. If biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately. If there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system. Landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a biogas. The waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above. This material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive. Biogas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas. Landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen. The lower explosive limit is methane and the upper is methane. The methane in biogas is times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Therefore uncontained landfill gas which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of global warming. In addition volatile organic compounds VOCs in landfill gas contribute to the formation of photochemical smog. Biochemical oxygen demand BOD is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of material being used in the biodigester as well as the BOD for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester. Another term related to biodigesters is effluent dirtiness which tells how much organic material there is per unit of biogas source. Typical units for this measure are in mg BOD litre. As an example effluent dirtiness can range between mg BOD litre in Panama. citation needed From kg of decommissioned kitchen bio waste . m of biogas can be obtained. The price for collecting biological waste from households is approximately per ton. The composition of biogas varies depending upon the substrate composition as well as the conditions within the anaerobic reactor temperature pH and substrate concentration . Landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around . Advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with methane which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to methane using in situ gas purification techniques. As produced biogas contains water vapor. The fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature correction of measured gas volume for water vapour content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas. In some cases biogas contains siloxanes. They are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents. During combustion of biogas containing siloxanes silicon is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the combustion gas. Deposits are formed containing mostly silica SiO or silicates SixOy and can contain calcium sulfur zinc phosphorus. Such white mineral deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means. Practical and cost effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available. For kg wet weight of input to a typical biodigester total solids may be of the wet weight while volatile suspended solids may be of the total solids. Protein would be of the volatile solids carbohydrates would be of the volatile solids and finally fats would be of the volatile solids. High levels of methane are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions. During storage and when manure has been applied to the land nitrous oxide is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process. Nitrous oxide NO is times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and methane times more than carbon dioxide. check quotation syntax By converting cow manure into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion the millions of cattle in the United States would be able to produce billion kiloWatt hours of electricity enough to power millions of homes across the United States. In fact one cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate kiloWatt hours of electricity only . kiloWatt hours of electricity are needed to power a single Watt light bulb for one day. Furthermore by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose global warming gases could be reduced by million metric tons or . Biogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works in a CHP gas engine where the waste heat from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester cooking space heating water heating and process heating. If compressed it can replace compressed natural gas for use in vehicles where it can fuel an internal combustion engine or fuel cells and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in on site CHP plants. Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly methane and CO with trace elements of HS inadequate for use in machinery. The corrosive nature of HS alone is enough to destroy the mechanisms. Methane in biogas can be concentrated via a biogas upgrader to the same standards as fossil natural gas which itself has to go through a cleaning process and becomes biomethane. If the local gas network allows the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks. Gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept. Carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide and particulates must be removed if present. There are four main methods of upgrading water washing pressure swing absorption selexol absorption and amine gas treating. In addition to these the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing and there are already several plants operating in Europe and USA. The most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter flow to the gas. This arrangement could deliver methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum methane loss in the system. It takes roughly between and of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system. Gas grid injection is the injection of biogas into the methane grid natural gas grid . Until the breakthrough of micro combined heat and power two thirds of all the energy produced by biogas power plants was lost as heat . Using the grid to transport the gas to customers the energy can be used for on site generation resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy. Typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from to in electricity transmission they range from to . Before being injected in the gas grid biogas passes a cleaning process during which it is upgraded to natural gas quality. During the cleaning process trace components harmful to the gas grid and the final users are removed. If concentrated and compressed it can be used in vehicle transportation. Compressed biogas is becoming widely used in Sweden Switzerland and Germany. A biogas powered train named Biogastget Amanda The Biogas Train Amanda has been in service in Sweden since . Biogas powers automobiles. In a British documentary film titled Sweet as a Nut detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom adapted combustion engine. In an estimated vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide mostly in Europe. Biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas or air category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream. The mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow. Biogas environments include wastewater digesters landfills and animal feeding operations covered livestock lagoons . Ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere. Most of thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking although there are single point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop. They can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value. Biogas can be used as the fuel in the system of producing biogas from agricultural wastes and co generating heat and electricity in a combined heat and power CHP plant. Unlike the other green energy such as wind and solar the biogas can be quickly accessed on demand. The global warming potential can also be greatly reduced when using biogas as the fuel instead of fossil fuel. However the acidification and eutrophication potentials produced by biogas are and times higher respectively than fossil fuel alternatives. This impact can be reduced by using correct combination of feedstocks covered storage for digesters and improved techniques for retrieving escaped material. Overall the results still suggest that using biogas can lead to significant reduction in most impacts compared to fossil fuel alternative. The balance between environmental damage and green house gas emission should still be considered while implicating the system. The European Union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the Landfill Directive. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long term revenue and energy security. The United States legislates against landfill gas as it contains VOCs. The United States Clean Air Act and Title of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non methane organic compounds NMOCs emitted. If the estimated NMOC emissions exceeds tonnes per year the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained NMOCs. That usually means burning it. Because of the remoteness of landfill sites it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas. With the many benefits of biogas it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the United States more. In the United States consumed trillion BTU of energy from landfill gas about . of the total U.S. natural gas consumption. Methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the U.S. According to a study collected by the Science and Children magazine methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce billion kilowatt hours enough to power millions of homes across America. Furthermore methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States. In Vermont for example biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the CVPS Cow Power program. The program was originally offered by Central Vermont Public Service Corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with Green Mountain Power is now the GMP Cow Power Program. Customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program. In Sheldon Vermont Green Mountain Dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the Cow Power program. It started when the brothers who own the farm Bill and Brian Rowell wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms including manure odor and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals. They installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their cows to produce renewable energy a bedding to replace sawdust and a plant friendly fertilizer. The energy and environmental attributes are sold to the GMP Cow Power program. On average the system run by the Rowells produces enough electricity to power to other homes. The generator capacity is about kilowatts. In Hereford Texas cow manure is being used to power an ethanol power plant. By switching to methane biogas the ethanol power plant has saved barrels of oil a day. Over all the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas. In Oakley Kansas an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in North America is using Integrated Manure Utilization System IMUS to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure municipal organics and ethanol plant waste. At full capacity the plant is expected to replace of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol and methanol. The level of development varies greatly in Europe. While countries such as Germany Austria and Sweden are fairly advanced in their use of biogas there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent especially in Eastern Europe. Different legal frameworks education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential. Another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception. In February the European Biogas Association EBA was founded in Brussels as a non profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in Europe. EBA s strategy defines three priorities establish biogas as an important part of Europe s energy mix promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel. In July it had members from countries across Europe. As of September update there are about non sewage biogas plants in the UK. Most are on farm and some larger facilities exist off farm which are taking food and consumer wastes. On October biogas was injected into the UK gas grid for the first time. Sewage from over Oxfordshire homes is sent to Didcot sewage treatment works where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately homes. In the Green Energy company Ecotricity announced their plans to build three grid injecting digesters. As of September update in Italy there are more than biogas plants with a production of about .GW Germany is Europe s biggest biogas producer and the market leader in biogas technology. In there were biogas plants operating throughout the country Lower Saxony Bavaria and the eastern federal states are the main regions. Most of these plants are employed as power plants. Usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a CHP which produces electric power by burning the bio methane. The electrical power is then fed into the public power grid. In the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was MW. The electricity supply was approximately . TWh which is . of the total generated renewable electricity. Biogas in Germany is primarily extracted by the co fermentation of energy crops called NawaRo an abbreviation of nachwachsende Rohstoffe German for renewable resources mixed with manure. The main crop used is corn. Organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation. In this respect biogas production in Germany differs significantly from the UK where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common. Biogas production in Germany has developed rapidly over the last years. The main reason is the legally created frameworks. Government support of renewable energy started in with the Electricity Feed in Act StrEG . This law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy. In the Electricity Feed in Act was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act EEG . This law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over years. The amount of around kWh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income. The German agricultural biogas production was given a further push in by implementing the so called NawaRo Bonus. This is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources that is energy crops. In the German government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the Integrated Climate and Energy Programme . This continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production. The first challenge to be noticed is the high area consuming of the biogas electric power supply. In energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa ha in Germany. This high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto. Moreover new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic political and civil background. Their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering. Finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the German renewable energy supply if good governance is focused. Biogas in India has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these gobar gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time especially in rural India. In the last decades research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the Deenabandhu model. The Deenabandhu Model is a new biogas production model popular in India. Deenabandhu means friend of the helpless. The unit usually has a capacity of to cubic metres. It is constructed using bricks or by a ferrocement mixture. In India the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model however India s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy offers some subsidy per model constructed. Biogas which is mainly methane natural gas can also be used for generating protein rich cattle poultry and fish feed in villages economically by cultivating Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria culture with tiny land and water foot print. The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can be put to use in cheaper production of algae oil or spirulina from algaculture particularly in tropical countries like India which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future. Union government of India is implementing many schemes to utilise productively the agro waste or biomass in rural areas to uplift rural economy and job potential. With these plants the non edible biomass or waste of edible biomass is converted in to high value products without any water pollution or green house gas GHG emissions. LPG Liquefied Petroleum Gas is a key source of cooking fuel in urban India and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices. Also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting LPG as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments. This has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to RCC and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct. Renewed focus on process technology like the Biourja process model has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in India as a potential alternative to LPG as primary cooking fuel. In India Nepal Pakistan and Bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of manure in small scale digestion facilities is called gobar gas it is estimated that such facilities exist in over million households in India in Bangladesh and thousands in Pakistan particularly North Punjab due to the thriving population of livestock. The digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection. The manure is directed to the pit usually straight from the cattle shed. The pit is filled with a required quantity of wastewater. The gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves. The combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke. Owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs. One type of these system is the Sintex Digester. Some designs use vermiculture to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost. In Pakistan the Rural Support Programmes Network is running the Pakistan Domestic Biogas Programme which has installed biogas plants and has trained in excess of masons on the technology and aims to develop the Biogas Sector in Pakistan. In Nepal the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant at home. The Chinese have experimented with the applications of biogas since . Around China had installed digesters in an effort to make agriculture more efficient. During the last years the technology has met high growth rates. This seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste. The rural biogas construction in China has shown an increased development trend. The exponential growth of energy supply caused by rapid economic development and severe haze condition in China have led biogas to become the better eco friendly energy for rural area. In Qing county Hebei Province the technology of using crop straw as main material to generate biogas is currently developing. China had . million biogas plants with an output of . billion cubic meter biogas until . The annual biogas output has increased to billion cubic meter in . The Chinese government had supported and funded rural biogas projects but only about were operating normally. During the winter the biogas production in northern regions of China is lower. This is caused by the lack of heat control technology for digesters thus the co digestion of different feedstock failed to complete in the cold environment. Domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry the fermented manure. This technology is feasible for small holders with livestock producing kg manure per day an equivalent of about pigs or cows. This manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant. Toilets can be connected. Another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process. With an optimum at C the technology especially applies for those living in a sub tropical climate. This makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable. Depending on size and location a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between US to in Asian countries and up to in the African context. A high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least years without major problems and re investments. For the user biogas provides clean cooking energy reduces indoor air pollution and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection especially for women and children. The slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity. Domestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world especially Asia. Several countries in this region have embarked on large scale programmes on domestic biogas such as China and India. The Netherlands Development Organisation SNV supports national programmes on domestic biogas that aim to establish commercial viable domestic biogas sectors in which local companies market install and service biogas plants for households. In Asia SNV is working in Nepal Vietnam Bangladesh Bhutan Cambodia Lao PDR Pakistan and Indonesia and in Africa Rwanda Senegal Burkina Faso Ethiopia Tanzania Uganda Kenya Benin and Cameroon. In South Africa a prebuilt Biogas system is manufactured and sold. One key feature is that installation requires less skill and is quicker to install as the digester tank is premade plastic. In the Australian film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the post apocalyptic settlement Barter town is powered by a central biogas system based upon a piggery. As well as providing electricity methane is used to power Barter s vehicles. Cow Town written in the early s discuss the travails of a city vastly built on cow manure and the hardships brought upon by the resulting methane biogas. Carter McCormick an engineer from a town outside the city is sent in to figure out a way to utilize this gas to help power rather than suffocate the city. The Biogas production is providing nowadays new opportunities for skilled employment drawing on the development of new technologies.",FALSE

Eco Efficiency has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of sustainable development. It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and pollution. It is measured as the ratio between the added value of what has been produced e.g. GDP and the added environment impacts of the product or service e.g. S emissions . The term was coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD in its publication Changing Course and at the Earth Summit eco efficiency was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement Agenda in the private sector. Ergo the term has become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards sustainability combining ecological and economic efficiency. Although eco efficiency is a rather new method the idea is not. In the early s Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren developed the lettering formula I PAT to describe the impact of human activity on the environment. Furthermore the concept of eco efficiency was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in but it wasn t until when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by Stephan Schmidheiny in Changing Course . Schmidheiny set out to change the perception of industry as being part of the problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part a key part of the solution for sustainability and global development. The major drivers in the early phase of eco efficiency s development were the forward looking managers and thinkers in M and Dow. It was their involvement which catapulted eco efficiency from a brilliant idea to a workable concept. The results of the WBCSD s work creating the linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value. According to the WBCSD definition eco efficiency is achieved through the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity throughout the entire life cycle to a level at least in line with the Earth s estimated carrying capacity. It works by implementing main types of ratios. The ratios may be applied to any unit comprising economic activities because such activities always relate to cost and value and having some physical substrate always influence the environment. Furthermore there are two different levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios micro and macro . There are three different methods to determine eco efficiency at the micro level. First incremental eco efficiency which specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects. Second an analysis method nicknamed win win which gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies. The win win micro method is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance. And the third is difference eco efficiency which is similar to the win win variant but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives. Now the macro level is much less defined and has shown less accurate results. However the ultimate aim of eco efficiency analysis is to help move micro level decision making into macro level optimality. The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macro level analysis at a country world scale. There are two life cycle assessment LCA based calculation systems on eco efficiency the Analysis Method of BASF and the method of the Eco costs value ratio of the Delft University of Technology. The reduction in ecological impacts translates into an increase in resource productivity which in turn can create a competitive advantage. According to the WBCSD critical aspects of eco efficiency are Strategies that have been linked to eco efficiency include Factor and Factor which call for specific reductions in resource use natural capitalism which incorporates eco efficiency as part of a broader strategy and the cradle to cradle movement which claims to go beyond eco efficiency in abolishing the very idea of waste. According to Boulanger all versions of eco efficiency share four key characteristics The view that improvements in eco efficiency are sufficient for achieving sustainability has been challenged by Huesemann and Huesemann who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution. Moreover with cradle to cradle growth is conducive to sustainability per se. This broader concept is called Sustainable Production and Consumption SPC . This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of natural resources business has taken a key role in accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce. Eco efficiency is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of sustainable development making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues. Furthermore eco efficiency is also a very useful tool because it can adapt and flex to be fit different sizes of companies while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies. For example larger national players such as the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD European Commission EU European Environment Agency EEA and the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy NRTEE have all recognized that eco efficiency is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives. It has been proven to heighten market values for firms serve as an effective management tool for governments benefit civil society and increase quality of life. It does this by changing industrial processes creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules. More people aim to get more value for their money in the market while also enjoying a better environment. Recently there has also been use of eco efficiency in more non traditional ways such as a use in banks to integrate environmental criteria into their credit approval process looking at eco integrated economic risks of a customer. And is also being implemented as marketing advantages where eco efficient choices are always preferred especially in service sectors such as tourism.",FALSE

In other words understanding mechanisms and processes at the genetic and molecular levels and applying this understanding to creating or improving industrial processes. The term is widely used by regional development agencies international organizations biotechnology companies. It is closely linked to the evolution of the biotechnology industry. The ability to study understand and manipulate genetic material has been possible due to scientific breakthroughs and technological progress. The evolution of the biotechnology industry and its application to agriculture health chemical or energy industries is a classic example of bioeconomic activity. The term was used by Juan Enrquez and Rodrigo Martinez at the Genomics Seminar in the AAAS meeting. An excerpt of this paper was published in Science. Enrquez and Martinez Harvard Business School working paper Biotechonomy . A Rough Map of Biodata Flow showed the global flow of genetic material into and out of the three largest public genetic databases GenBank EMBL and DDBJ. The authors then hypothesized about the economic impact that such data flows might have on patent creation evolution of biotech startups and licensing fees. An adaptation of this paper was published in Wired magazine in . Since about the creation of a biobased economy has been a significant issue in the Netherlands. Pilot plants have been started i.e. in Lelystad Zeafuels and a centralised organisation exists Interdepartementaal programma biobased economy with supporting research Food Biobased Research being conducted. In president Barack Obama of the USA announced intentions to encourage biological manufacturing methods with a National Bioeconomy Blueprint. In the same year in Belgium the Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant was set up. The biobased economy uses first generation biomass crops second generation biomass crop refuge and third generation biomass seaweed algae . Several methods of processing are then used in biorefineries to gather the most out of the biomass. This includes techniques such as Anaerobic digestion is generally used to produce biogas fermentation of sugars produces ethanol pyrolysis is used to produce pyrolysis oil which is solidified biogas and torrefaction is used to create biomass coal. Biomass coal and biogas is then burnt for energy production ethanol can be used as a vehicle fuel as well as for other purposes such as skincare products. For economic reasons the processing of the biomass is done according to a specific pattern. This pattern as well as the quantities depends on the types of biomass used. The whole of finding the most suitable pattern is known as biorefining. A general list shows the products with high added value and lowest volume of biomass to the products with the lowest added value and highest volume of biomass Some research is being conducted as well in order to improve the manufacturing processes.

"16",16,"food waste","/wiki/Food_waste",TRUE,0,"waste|","Food waste or food loss is food that is discarded or lost uneaten","Food waste or food loss is food that is discarded or lost uneaten. The causes of food waste or loss are numerous and occur at the stages of producing processing retailing and consuming. Global food loss and waste amount to between one third and one half of all food produced. Loss and wastage occur at all stages of the food supply chain or value chain. In low income countries most loss occurs during production while in developed countries much food about kilograms lb per person per year is wasted at the consumption stage. Food waste is food that is lost during any of the four stages of the food supply chain producers processors retailers and consumers. Precise definitions are contentious often defined on a situational basis as is the case more generally with definitions of waste . x xiProfessional bodies including international organizations state governments and secretariats may use their own definitions. Among other things in what food waste consists of how it is produced and where or what it is discarded from or generated by. Definitions also vary because certain groups do not consider or have traditionally not considered food waste to be a waste material due to its applications. Some definitions of what food waste consists of are based on other waste definitions e.g. agricultural waste and which materials do not meet their definitions. Lost food may go to landfills be put back into the food supply chain or be put to other nonfood productive uses. Under the UN s Save Food initiative the FAO UNEP and stakeholders have agreed on the following definition of food loss and waste Important components of this definition include In the European Union food waste was defined as any food substance raw or cooked which is discarded or intended or required to be discarded since until when the old directive was repealed by Directive EC which has no specific definition of food waste. The directive EEC containing this definition was amended in with the addition of categories of waste Annex I and the omission of any reference to national law. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines food waste for the United States as uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and commercial establishments such as grocery stores restaurants and produce stands institutional cafeterias and kitchens and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms . The states remain free to define food waste differently for their purposes though many choose not to. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council Americans throw away up to of food that is safe to eat. The definitions by the UN and EU have come under criticism for including food that goes to nonfood productive use in their definitions of food waste. According to the authors of one study this is flawed for two reasons First if recovered food is used as an input such as animal feed fertilizer or biomass to produce output then by definition it is not wasted. However there might be economic losses if the cost of recovered food is higher than the average cost of inputs in the alternative nonfood use. Second the definition creates practical problems for measuring food waste because the measurement requires tracking food loss in every stage of the supply chain and its proportion that flows to nonfood uses. The authors of the study argue that only food that ends up in landfills should be counted as food waste. In the US food waste can occur at most stages of the food industry and in significant amounts. In subsistence agriculture the amounts of food waste are unknown but are likely to be insignificant by comparison due to the limited stages at which waste can occur and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a global marketplace demand. Nevertheless on farm losses in storage in developing countries particularly in African countries can be high although the exact nature of such losses is much debated. In the food industry of the United States the food supply of which is the most diverse and abundant of any country in the world waste occurs from the beginning of food production chain. From planting crops can be subjected to pest infestations and severe weather which cause losses before harvest. Since natural forces e.g. temperature and precipitation remain the primary drivers of crop growth losses from these can be experienced by all forms of outdoor agriculture. On average farms in the United States lose up to six billion pounds of crops every year because of these unpredictable conditions. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops or collect only part of a crop. Economic factors such as regulations and standards for quality and appearance also cause food waste farmers often harvest selectively preferring to leave crops not to standard in the field where they can be used as fertilizer or animal feed since they would otherwise be discarded later. This method of removing undesirable produce from harvest collection distribution sites and grocery stores is called Culling. The USDA defines culling as the individual removal of genetically undesirable inferior weak diseased or infested plants from a planting in order to ensure the level of genetic purity or vigor of the crop . However usually when culling occurs at the production food processing retail and consumption stages it is to remove or dispose of produce with a strange or imperfect appearance rather than produce that is spoiled or unsafe to eat. In urban areas fruit and nut trees often go unharvested because people either don t realize that the fruit is edible or they fear that it is contaminated despite research which shows that urban fruit is safe to consume. Food waste continues in the post harvest stage but the amounts of post harvest loss involved are relatively unknown and difficult to estimate. Regardless the variety of factors that contribute to food waste both biological environmental and socio economical would limit the usefulness and reliability of general figures. In storage considerable quantitative losses can be attributed to pests and micro organisms. citation needed This is a particular problem for countries that experience a combination of heat around C and ambient humidity between and per cent as such conditions encourage the reproduction of insect pests and micro organisms. Losses in the nutritional value caloric value and edibility of crops by extremes of temperature humidity or the action of micro organisms also account for food waste. Further losses are generated in the handling of food and by shrinkage in weight or volume. Some of the food waste produced by processing can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product. Food safety regulations are able to claim foods which contradict standards before they reach markets. Although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food waste such as in animal feed safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer they are vitally important especially in the processing of foodstuffs of animal origin e.g. meat and dairy products as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards. Packaging protects food from damage during its transportation from farms and factories via warehouses to retailing as well as preserving its freshness upon arrival. Although it avoids considerable food waste packaging can compromise efforts to reduce food waste in other ways such as by contaminating waste that could be used for animal feedstocks. In the non profit Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC performed research that they state suggests that the leading cause of food waste in America is due to uncertainty over food expiration dates such as confusion in deciphering best before sell by or use by dates. Joined by Harvard Law the NRDC produced a study called The Dating Game How Confusing Food Date Labels Leads to Food Waste in America. This United States based study looked at the intertwining laws which lead labeling to end up unclear and erratic. This uncertainty leads to consumers to toss food most often because they think the food may be unsafe or misunderstand the labeling on the food completely. Lack of regulation on labeling can result in large quantities of food being removed from the market overall. Retail stores throw away large quantities of food. Usually this consists of items that have reached either their best before sell by or use by dates. Food that has passed the best before and sell by date and even some food that passed the use by date is still edible at the time of disposal but stores have widely varying policies to handle the excess food. Some stores put effort into preventing access to poor or homeless people while others work with charitable organizations to distribute food. Retailers also contribute to waste as a result of their contractual arrangements with suppliers. Failure to supply agreed quantities renders farmers or processors liable to have their contracts cancelled. As a consequence they plan to produce more than actually required to meet the contract to have a margin of error. Surplus production is often simply disposed of. Retailers usually have strict cosmetic standards for produce and if fruits or vegetables are misshapen or superficially bruised they are often not put on the shelf. In the United States an estimated six billion pounds of produce is wasted each year because of its appearance. The USDA publishes guidelines used as a baseline assessment by produce distributors grocery stores restaurants and other consumers in order to rate the quality of food. These guidelines and how they rate are readily available on their website. For example apples get graded by their size color wax residue firmness and skin appearance. If an apples rank highly in these categories and show close to no superficial defects they are rated as U.S. Extra Fancy or U.S. Fancy these are the typical ratings sought out by grocery stores when purchasing their produce. Any apples with suboptimal levels of appearance are ranked as either U.S. Number or Utility and are not normally purchased for retail as recommended by produce marketing sources despite being safe and edible. The fish industry also contributes to the annual amount of food waste because of cosmetic standards that the fish are held up to. Nearly . million tonnes of fish are discarded in the North Atlantic and the North Sea each year. Approximately to percent of all fish caught in Europe is discarded either because they are the wrong size or species. Addressing this there are many campaigns focused on raising retailer and consumer awareness about food that fails to meet certain standards for appearance. Consumers are directly and indirectly responsible for wasting a lot of food which could for a large part be avoided if they were willing to accept suboptimal food SOF that deviates in sensory characteristics odd shapes discolourations or has a best before date that is approaching or has passed but is still perfectly fine to eat. COSUS COnsumers in a SUStainable food supply chain is a SUSFOOD ERA net research project under the topic Understanding consumer behaviour to encourage a more sustainable food choice . The SIK study estimated the total of global food loss and waste to around one third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption amounting to about . billion tonnes . long tons . short tons per year. As the following table shows industrialized and developing countries differ substantially. In developing countries it is estimated that calories per day per person are going to waste while in developed countries calories per day per person are wasted. In the former more than of losses occur at the postharvest and processing stages while in the latter more than of losses occur at the retail and consumer levels. The total food waste by consumers in industrialized countries million tonnes or long tons or short tons is almost equal to the entire food production in sub Saharan Africa million tonnes or long tons or short tons . A report from the British Institution of Mechanical Engineers IME likewise estimated that or . billion tonnes or . . long tons or . . short tons of all food produced remains uneaten. Each year in New South Wales more than million meals are delivered by charity OzHarvest from food that would otherwise be wasted. According to Ministry of Environment Denmark over tonnes per year of food is wasted every year in Denmark in the entire food value chain from farm to fork. Due to the work of activist Selina Juul s Stop Wasting Food movement Denmark has achieved a national reduction in food waste by in years . According to the research of National Food Chain Safety Office an average Hungarian consumer gerenates kg food waste annually. of this amount would be avoidable. According to a publication of Wageningen University and Research report it is estimated that in the Netherlands between and of all food produced is lost or thrown away. In total people in the Netherlands waste at least .m tonnes of food per year worth at least .bn. In Singapore tonnes long tons short tons of food was wasted in . Of that tonnes long tons short tons were recycled. Since Singapore has limited agriculture ability the country spent about S . billion US . billion on importing food in . US . billion of it ends up being wasted or percent. In the UK tonnes long tons short tons per year of wasted food purchased and edible food which is discarded amounts to a cost of . billion each year. This represents costs of to a year per household. Estimates of food waste in the United States range from million tons to million tons. In a study done by National Geographic in Elizabeth Royte indicated more than percent of food in the United States valued at billion annually isn t eaten. The University of Arizona conducted a study in which indicated that to of United States edible food is untouched or unopened amounting to billion worth of discarded but edible food. In the United States Department of Agriculture has come forth with estimations from the Economic Research Service that approximates food waste in the United States to be equivalent to trillion calories. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO food waste is responsible for percent of global man made greenhouse gas emissions. The FAO concludes that nearly percent of all available agricultural land in the world . billion hectares is used for produced but uneaten food. The global blue water footprint of food waste is km that is the amount of water that flows annually through the Volga or times Lake Geneva. Response to the problem of food waste at all social levels has varied hugely including campaigns from advisory and environmental groups and concentrated media attention on the subject. One way of dealing with food waste is to reduce its creation. Consumers can reduce spoilage by planning their food shopping avoiding potentially wasteful spontaneous purchases and storing foods properly and also preventing a too large buildup of perishable stock . Widespread educational campaigns have been shown to be an effective way to reduce food waste. A British campaign called Love Food Hate Waste has raised awareness about preventative measures to address food waste for consumers. Through advertisements information on food storage and preparation and in store education the UK observed a decrease in avoidable household food waste over the course of years. Another potential solution is for smart packaging which would indicate when food is spoiled more precisely than expiration dates currently do for example with temperature sensitive ink plastic that changes color when exposed to oxygen or gels that change color with time. An initiative in Curitiba Brazil called Cambio Verde allows farmers to provide surplus produce produce they would otherwise discard due to too low prices to people that bring glass and metal to recycling facilities to encourage further waste reduction . In Europe the Food Surplus Entrepreneurs Network FSE Network coordinates a network of social businesses and nonprofit initiatives with the goal to spread best practices to increase the use of surplus food and reduction of food waste. In areas where the waste collection is a public function food waste is usually managed by the same governmental organization as other waste collection. Most food waste is combined with general waste at the source. Separate collections also known as source separated organics have the advantage that food wastes can be disposed of in ways not applicable to other wastes. In the United States companies find higher and better uses for large commercial generators of food and beverage waste. From the end of the th century through the middle of the th century many municipalities collected food waste called garbage as opposed to trash separately. This was typically disinfected by steaming and fed to pigs either on private farms or in municipal piggeries. Separate curbside collection of food waste is now being revived in some areas. To keep collection costs down and raise the rate of food waste segregation some local authorities especially in Europe have introduced alternate weekly collections of biodegradable waste including e.g. garden waste which enable a wider range of recyclable materials to be collected at reasonable cost and improve their collection rates. However they result in a two week wait before the waste will be collected. The criticism is that particularly during hot weather food waste rots and stinks and attracts vermin. Waste container design is therefore essential to making such operations feasible. Curbside collection of food waste is also done in the U.S. some ways by combining food scraps and yard waste together. Several states in the U.S. have introduced a yard waste ban not accepting leaves brush trimmings etc. in landfills. Collection of food scraps and yard waste combined is then recycled and composted for reuse. As alternatives to landfill food waste can be composted to produce soil and fertilizer fed to animals or used to produce energy or fuel. Dumping food waste in a landfill causes odour as it decomposes attracts flies and vermin and has the potential to add biological oxygen demand BOD to the leachate. The European Union Landfill Directive and Waste Regulations like regulations in other countries which enjoin diverting organic wastes away from landfill disposal for these reasons. Starting in organic waste from New York City restaurants will be banned from landfills. In countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom food scraps constitute around of the waste dumped in landfills where it ends up rotting and producing methane a greenhouse gas. Methane or CH is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas that is released into the air also produced by landfills in the U.S. Although methane spends less time in the atmosphere years than CO it s more efficient at trapping radiation. It is times greater to impact climate change than CO in a year period. Humans accounts over of methane emissions globally. Large quantities of fish meat dairy and grain are discarded at a global scale annually when they can be used for things other than human consumption. The feeding of food scraps to domesticated animals is historically the most common way of dealing with household food waste. The animals turn roughly two thirds of their ingested food into gas or fecal waste while the last third is digested and repurposed as meat or dairy products. There are also different ways of growing produce and feeding livestock that could ultimately reduce waste. Bread and other cereal products discarded from the human food chain could be used to feed chickens. Chickens have traditionally been given mixtures of waste grains and milling by products in a mixture called chicken scratch. As well giving table scraps to backyard chickens is a large part of that movement s claim to sustainability though not all backyard chicken growers recommend it. Ruminants and pigs have also been fed bakery waste for a long time. Certain food waste such as flesh can also be used as feed in maggot farming. The maggots can then be fed to other animals. Food waste can be biodegraded by composting and reused to fertilize soil. Composting is the aerobic process completed by microorganisms in which the bacteria break down the food waste into simpler organic materials that can then be used in soil. By redistributing nutrients and high microbial populations compost reduces water runoff and soil erosion by enhancing rainfall penetration which has been shown to reduce the loss of sediment nutrients and pesticide losses to streams by . Traditional composting uses microbes to perform the decomposition a process that is most efficient using low mid and high temperature microbes psychrophilic mesophilic and thermophilic respectively . The high temperatures required by the thermophilic microorganisms are hot enough to kill pathogens making the product of this traditional composting satisfactory for use in soil according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency s EPA standards. The traditional decomposition process requires a long length of time and additional energy expended to turn the material frequently and maintain the aerobic process. Composting by thermophilic microbes can lead to nutrient loss and the compost product is heterogeneous with the potential for higher levels of contaminants which can be harmful if used in agriculture. An alternate method of composting is vermicomposting. Vermicomposting is the practise of feeding scraps to worms who produce fertilized soil as a byproduct. The process of composting using earth worms is completed in a short duration of time and requires no additional energy to turn and maintain aerobic processes as these actions are already performed by the worms. In order to keep the worms alive the environment has to be kept below Celsius therein making this compost ineligible for use in agriculture according to the EPA standards. The product of vermicomposting is homogenous and generally contains lower levels of contaminants than traditional composting. Some look to integrate vermicomposting and traditional composting in an effort to maximize efficiency while producing a high quality organic product that can be used in agriculture. Composting food waste leads to a decrease in the quantity of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. In landfills organic food waste decomposes anaerobically producing methane gas that is emitted into the atmosphere. When this biodegradable waste is composted it decomposes aerobically and does not produce methane but instead produces organic compost that can then be utilized in agriculture. Recently the city of New York has begun to require that restaurants and food producing companies begin to compost their leftover food. Another instance of composting progress is a Wisconsin based company called WasteCap who is dedicated towards aiding local communities create composting plans. Municipal Food Waste MFW can be composted to create this product of organic fertilizer and many municipalities choose to do this citing environmental protection and economic efficiency as reasoning. Transporting and dumping waste in landfills requires both money and room in the landfills that have very limited available space. One municipality who chose to regulate MFW is San Francisco who requires citizens to separate compost from trash on their own instituting fines for non compliance at for individual homes and for businesses. The city s economic reasoning for this controversial mandate is supported by their estimate that one business can save up to annually on garbage disposal costs with the implementation of the required composting. Composting is an economical and environmentally conscious step many homeowners could take to reduce their impact on landfill waste. Instead of food scraps and spoiled food taking up space in trashcans or stinking up the kitchen before the bag is full it could be put outside and broken down by worms and added to garden beds. Anaerobic digestion produces both useful gaseous products and a solid fibrous compostable material. Anaerobic digestion plants can provide energy from waste by burning the methane created from food and other organic wastes to generate electricity defraying the plants costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of anaerobic composting allows for large amounts of food waste to avoid the landfills. Instead of producing these greenhouse gasses into the environment from being in a landfill the gasses can alternatively be harnessed in these facilities for reuse. Since this process of composting produces high volumes of biogas there are potential safety issues such as explosion and poisoning. These interactions require proper maintenance and personal protective equipment is utilized. Certain U.S. states such as Oregon have implemented the requirement for permits on such facilities based on the potential danger to the population and surrounding environment. Food waste coming through the sanitary sewers from garbage disposal units is treated along with other sewage and contributes to sludge. Commercially food waste in the form of wastewater coming from commercial kitchens sinks dishwashers and floor drains is collected in holding tanks called grease interceptors to minimize flow to the sewer system. This often foul smelling waste contains both organic and inorganic waste chemical cleaners etc. and may also contain hazardous hydrogen sulfide gases. It is referred to as fats oils and grease FOG waste or more commonly brown grease versus yellow grease which is fryer oil that is easily collected and processed into biodiesel and is an overwhelming problem especially in the US for the aging sewer systems. Per the US EPA sanitary sewer overflows also occur due to the improper discharge of FOGs to the collection system. Overflows discharge billion US gallons m billion US gallons m of untreated wastewater annually into local waterways and up to illnesses annually are due to exposure to contamination from sanitary sewer overflows into recreational waters. Nearly all global produce eaten or disposed of is grown using irrigated water. Irrigated water represents the largest sector of water withdraws worldwide with as much as of total water withdraws being allocated towards agricultural usage. Food which goes uneaten can account for vast quantities of water waste with food waste being the largest area the average US citizen contributes to water waste. In China some food waste is being processed by feeding it to cockroaches.",FALSE
"17",17,"bioenergy","/wiki/Bioenergy",TRUE,0,"material|energy|material|","Bioenergy is renewable energy made available from materials derived from biological sources","Bioenergy is renewable energy made available from materials derived from biological sources. Biomass is any organic material which has stored sunlight in the form of chemical energy. As a fuel it may include wood wood waste straw and other crop residues manure sugarcane and many other by products from a variety of agricultural processes. By there was GW hp of globally installed bioenergy capacity for electricity generation of which GW hp was in the United States. In its most narrow sense it is a synonym to biofuel which is fuel derived from biological sources. In its broader sense it includes biomass the biological material used as a biofuel as well as the social economic scientific and technical fields associated with using biological sources for energy. This is a common misconception as bioenergy is the energy extracted from the biomass as the biomass is the fuel and the bioenergy is the energy contained in the fuel There is a slight tendency for the word bioenergy to be favoured in Europe compared with biofuel in America. One of the advantages of biomass fuel is that it is often a by product residue or waste product of other processes such as farming animal husbandry and forestry. In theory this means there is no competition between fuel and food production although this is not always the case. Land use existing biomass industries and relevant conversion technologies must be considered when evaluating suitability of developing biomass as feedstock for energy. Biomass is the material derived from recently living organisms which includes plants animals and their byproducts. Manure garden waste and crop residues are all sources of biomass. It is a renewable energy source based on the carbon cycle unlike other natural resources such as petroleum coal and nuclear fuels. Another source includes Animal waste which is a persistent and unavoidable pollutant produced primarily by the animals housed in industrial sized farms. There are also agricultural products specifically being grown for biofuel production. These include corn and soybeans and to some extent willow and switchgrass on a pre commercial research level primarily in the United States rapeseed wheat sugar beet and willow ha or acres in Sweden primarily in Europe sugarcane in Brazil palm oil and miscanthus in Southeast Asia sorghum and cassava in China and jatropha in India. Hemp has also been proven to work as a biofuel. Biodegradable outputs from industry agriculture forestry and households can be used for biofuel production using e.g. anaerobic digestion to produce biogas gasification to produce syngas or by direct combustion. Examples of biodegradable wastes include straw timber manure rice husks sewage and food waste. The use of biomass fuels can therefore contribute to waste management as well as fuel security and help to prevent or slow down climate change although alone they are not a comprehensive solution to these problems. Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas also called landfill gas or biogas. Crops such as corn and sugar cane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol. Biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from left over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats. Also Biomass to liquids BTLs and cellulosic ethanol are still under research. The use of municipal and household waste is on the forefront of new sources for biomass and is a largely discarded resource on which new research is being conducted for use of energy production. A new bioenergy sewage treatment process aimed at developing countries is now on the horizon the Omni Processor is a self sustaining process which uses the sewerage solids as fuel to convert sewage waste water into drinking water and electrical energy. Sewage sludge is a point of focus in current research for developing bioenergy from biomass. The large quantity being produced by households at a continuous rate presents an opportunity to extract valuable compounds contained within it which can be then used to produce bioenergy. The main form of bioenergy being produced from sewage is methane but producing other forms is still being researched. The use of sewage to produce methane reduces the amount of waste put into landfills its costs of transportation and disposal and also keeps a larger amount of gas out of the atmosphere as more is able to be captured. . The biomass used for electricity production ranges by region. Forest byproducts such as wood residues are popular in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius sugar cane residue and Southeast Asia rice husks . Animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter is popular in the UK. Sucrose accounts for little more than of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant is in the leaves and stem tips which are left in the fields during harvest and are in the fibrous material bagasse left over from pressing. The production process of sugar and ethanol in takes full advantage of the energy stored in sugarcane. Part of the bagasse is currently burned at the mill to provide heat for distillation and electricity to run the machinery. This allows ethanol plants to be energetically self sufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities current production is MW hp for self use and MW hp for sale. This secondary activity is expected to boom now that utilities have been induced to pay fair price about US GJ or US . kWh for year contracts. This is approximately half of what the World Bank considers the reference price for investing in similar projects see below . The energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low. Estimates of potential power generation from bagasse range from to MW to hp depending on technology. Higher estimates assume gasification of biomass replacement of current low pressure steam boilers and turbines by high pressure ones and use of harvest trash currently left behind in the fields. For comparison Brazil s Angra I nuclear plant generates MW hp . Presently it is economically viable to extract about MJ of electricity from the residues of one tonne of sugarcane of which about MJ are used in the plant itself. Thus a medium size distillery processing tonnes long tons short tons of sugarcane per year could sell about MW hp of surplus electricity. At current prices it would earn US million from sugar and ethanol sales and about US million from surplus electricity sales. With advanced boiler and turbine technology the electricity yield could be increased to MJ per tonne of sugarcane but current electricity prices do not justify the necessary investment. According to one report the World Bank would only finance investments in bagasse power generation if the price were at least US GJ or US . kWh. Bagasse burning is environmentally friendly compared to other fuels like oil and coal. Its ash content is only . against of coal and it contains very little sulfur. Since it burns at relatively low temperatures it produces little nitrous oxides. Moreover bagasse is being sold for use as a fuel replacing heavy fuel oil in various industries including citrus juice concentrate vegetable oil ceramics and Tyre Recycling. The state of So Paulo alone used tonnes long tons short tons saving about US million in fuel oil imports. Researchers working with cellulosic ethanol are trying to make the extraction of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and other plants viable on an industrial scale. Another form of bioenergy can be attained from microbial fuel cells in which chemical energy stored in wastewater or soil is converted directly into electrical energy via the metabolic processes of electrogenic micro organisms. The power generation capability of this technology has not been found to be economically viable till date however this technology has found been found to be more useful for chemical treatment processes and student education. Some forms of forest bioenergy have recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council for the harmful impacts they can have on forests and the climate. Greenpeace recently released a report entitled Fuelling a BioMess permanent dead link which outlines their concerns around forest bioenergy. Because any part of the tree can be burned the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages Whole Tree Harvesting which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting and can be harmful to the long term health of the forest. In some jurisdictions forest biomass is increasingly consisting of elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems including standing trees naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest. Environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees and even longer in low productivity areas furthermore logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon. In light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change a number of environmental groups are opposing the large scale use of forest biomass in energy production. The New Scientist described a scenario in a September article which illustrated why the journal believed bioenergy can be bad Suppose you cut down a year oak tree in your garden and use the logs to heat your house instead of coal. Wood emits more carbon dioxide than coal per unit of heat gained and the roots left in the soil emit more carbon dioxide as they rot. If you plant another tree it will soak up that carbon dioxide in about years. But if you had left the original tree in place it would have soaked up the carbon dioxide from the coal and more. It could take centuries before cutting down the tree would give any benefit. But the world needed to cut carbon dioxide over the next few decades if the global warming was to be kept below degrees C. The journal also concluded that official claimed carbon reductions from renewables had been overstated. The European Union for example got more of its renewable energy from biomass mostly wood but United Nations and EU rules did not count the carbon emissions from burning biomass. Recently a new company called Mango materials used bacterial fermentation to produce an intracellular biopolymer polyhydroxyalkanoate from methane. The great advantage of biopolymers is that it is biodegradable which makes it environment friendly. Because methane is being used that decreases the price of polymers that it would compete with traditional plastics. Also because methane would be converted into biopolymer that would reduce methane emissions. Chief Executive Officer Molly Morse said that the unused methane would be enough to produce more than three billion pounds of biopolymer. Morse announced in that using this polymer will reduce the waste in the textile industry because it will be reproduced as biopolymer again in every effective industrial loop.",FALSE
"18",18,"e-waste","/wiki/Electronic_waste",TRUE,0,"waste|","Electronic waste or e waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices"," Electronic waste or e waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics which are destined for refurbishment reuse resale salvage recycling through material recovery or disposal are also considered e waste. Informal processing of e waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution. Electronic scrap components such as CPUs contain potentially harmful materials such as lead cadmium beryllium or brominated flame retardants. Recycling and disposal of e waste may involve significant risk to health of workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes. Electronic waste or electronic waste is created when an electronic product is discarded after the end of its useful life. The rapid expansion of technology and the consumption driven society results in the creation of a very large amount of e waste is every minute. The European WEEE Directive classifies waste in ten categories Large household appliances including cooling and freezing appliances Small household appliances IT equipment including monitors Consumer electronics including TVs Lamps and Luminaires Toys Tools Medical devices Monitoring and control instruments and Automatic dispensers. These include used electronics which are destined for reuse resale salvage recycling or disposal as well as re usables working and repairable electronics and secondary raw materials copper steel plastic etc. . The term waste is reserved for residue or material which is dumped by the buyer rather than recycled including residue from reuse and recycling operations because loads of surplus electronics are frequently commingled good recyclable and non recyclable . Several public policy advocates apply the term e waste and e scrap broadly to all surplus electronics. Cathode ray tubes CRTs are considered one of the hardest types to recycle. CRTs have a relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors not to be confused with phosphorus both of which are necessary for the display. The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of hazardous household waste but considers CRTs that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded speculatively accumulated or left unprotected from weather and other damage. These CRT devices are often confused between the DLP Rear Projection TV both of which have a different recycling process due to the materials of which they are composed. The EU and its member states operate a system via the European Waste Catalogue EWC a European Council Directive which is interpreted into member state law . In the UK this is in the form of the List of Wastes Directive. However the list and EWC gives a broad definition EWC Code of what is hazardous electronic waste requiring waste operators to employ the Hazardous Waste Regulations Annex A Annex B for refined definition. Constituent materials in the waste also require assessment via the combination of Annex II and Annex III again allowing operators to further determine whether a waste is hazardous. Debate continues over the distinction between commodity and waste electronics definitions. Some exporters are accused of deliberately leaving difficult to recycle obsolete or non repairable equipment mixed in loads of working equipment though this may also come through ignorance or to avoid more costly treatment processes . Protectionists may broaden the definition of waste electronics in order to protect domestic markets from working secondary equipment. The high value of the computer recycling subset of electronic waste working and reusable laptops desktops and components like RAM can help pay the cost of transportation for a larger number of worthless pieces than what can be achieved with display devices which have less or negative scrap value. In A report Ghana E Waste Country Assessment found that of tons of electronics imported to Ghana were brand new and were used. Of the used product the study concluded that was not reused and was scrapped or discarded. This contrasts with published but uncredited claims that of the imports into Ghana were being burned in primitive conditions. Rapid changes in technology changes in media tapes software MP falling prices and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fast growing surplus of electronic waste around the globe. Technical solutions are available but in most cases a legal framework a collection logistics and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied. Display units CRT LCD LED monitors processors CPU GPU or APU chips memory DRAM or SRAM and audio components have different useful lives. Processors are most frequently out dated by software no longer being optimized and are more likely to become e waste while display units are most often replaced while working without repair attempts due to changes in wealthy nation appetites for new display technology. This problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or Phonebloks. These types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly. Being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce e waste. An estimated million tons of E waste are produced each year. The USA discards million computers each year and million phones are disposed of in Europe each year. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that only of e waste is recycled the rest of these electronics go directly into landfills and incinerators. In the United Nations estimated the amount of worldwide electronic waste discarded each year to be million metric tons. According to a report by UNEP titled Recycling from E Waste to Resources the amount of e waste being produced including mobile phones and computers could rise by as much as percent over the next decade in some countries such as India. The United States is the world leader in producing electronic waste tossing away about million tons each year. China already produces about . million tons estimate domestically second only to the United States. And despite having banned e waste imports China remains a major e waste dumping ground for developed countries. Society today revolves around technology and by the constant need for the newest and most high tech products we are contributing to a mass amount of e waste. Since the invention of the iPhone cell phones have become the top source of e waste products because they are not made to last more than two years. citation needed Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to elements can be found in complex electronics. As of Apple has sold over million iDevices iPod iPhone iPad . Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones. Companies give these products such short lifespans because they know that the consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it. better source needed In the United States an estimated of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics. While there is agreement that the number of discarded electronic devices is increasing there is considerable disagreement about the relative risk compared to automobile scrap for example and strong disagreement whether curtailing trade in used electronics will improve conditions or make them worse. According to an article in Motherboard attempts to restrict the trade have driven reputable companies out of the supply chain with unintended consequences. One theory is that increased regulation of electronic wastes and concern over the environmental harm in nature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export. Critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is still too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries such as China India and parts of Africa thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes the processing of which is expensive and difficult . The developing countries have become toxic dump yards of e waste. Developing countries receiving foreign e waste often go further to repair and recycle forsaken equipment. Yet still of e waste ended up in landfills in developing countries in . Proponents of international trade point to the success of fair trade programs in other industries where cooperation has led to creation of sustainable jobs and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher. Defenders of the trade who in used electronics say that extraction of metals from virgin mining has been shifted to developing countries. Recycling of copper silver gold and other materials from discarded electronic devices is considered better for the environment than mining. They also state that repair and reuse of computers and televisions has become a lost art in wealthier nations and that refurbishing has traditionally been a path to development. South Korea Taiwan and southern China all excelled in finding retained value in used goods and in some cases have set up billion dollar industries in refurbishing used ink cartridges single use cameras and working CRTs. Refurbishing has traditionally been a threat to established manufacturing and simple protectionism explains some criticism of the trade. Works like The Waste Makers by Vance Packard explain some of the criticism of exports of working product for example the ban on import of tested working Pentium laptops to China or the bans on export of used surplus working electronics by Japan. Opponents of surplus electronics exports argue that lower environmental and labour standards cheap labour and the relatively high value of recovered raw materials lead to a transfer of pollution generating activities such as smelting of copper wire. In China Malaysia India Kenya and various African countries electronic waste is being sent to these countries for processing sometimes illegally. Many surplus laptops are routed to developing nations as dumping grounds for e waste . Because the United States has not ratified the Basel Convention or its Ban Amendment and has few domestic federal laws forbidding the export of toxic waste the Basel Action Network estimates that about of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries and the World Reuse Repair and Recycling Association. Independent research by Arizona State University showed that of imported used computers did not have a higher value than the best value of the constituent materials they contained and that the official trade in end of life computers is thus driven by reuse as opposed to recycling . Proponents of the trade say growth of internet access is a stronger correlation to trade than poverty. Haiti is poor and closer to the port of New York than southeast Asia but far more electronic waste is exported from New York to Asia than to Haiti. Thousands of men women and children are employed in reuse refurbishing repair and re manufacturing unsustainable industries in decline in developed countries. Denying developing nations access to used electronics may deny them sustainable employment affordable products and internet access or force them to deal with even less scrupulous suppliers. In a series of seven articles for The Atlantic Shanghai based reporter Adam Minter describes many of these computer repair and scrap separation activities as objectively sustainable. Opponents of the trade argue that developing countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful. An expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire in order to melt plastics and to burn away non valuable metals. This releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air contributing to an acrid lingering smog. These noxious fumes include dioxins and furans. Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies. In June a container of electronic waste destined from the Port of Oakland in the U.S. to Sanshui District in mainland China was intercepted in Hong Kong by Greenpeace. Concern over exports of electronic waste were raised in press reports in India Ghana Cte d Ivoire and Nigeria. The research that was undertaken by the Countering WEEE Illegal Trade CWIT project funded by European Commission found that in Europe only . million tons of all the e waste discarded in ended up in the officially reported amounts of collection and recycling systems. The other . million tons was either Guiyu in the Shantou region of China is a massive electronic waste processing community. It is often referred to as the e waste capital of the world. Traditionally Guiyu was an agricultural community however in the mid s it transformed into an e waste recycling center involving over of the local households and an additional migrant workers. Thousands of individual workshops employ laborers to snip cables pry chips from circuit boards grind plastic computer cases into particles and dip circuit boards in acid baths to dissolve the precious metals. Others work to strip insulation from all wiring in an attempt to salvage tiny amounts of copper wire. Uncontrolled burning disassembly and disposal has led to a number of environmental problems such as groundwater contamination atmospheric pollution and water pollution either by immediate discharge or from surface runoff especially near coastal areas as well as health problems including occupational safety and health effects among those directly and indirectly involved due to the methods of processing the waste. Six of the many villages in Guiyu specialize in circuit board disassembly seven in plastics and metals reprocessing and two in wire and cable disassembly. Greenpeace an environmental group sampled dust soil river sediment and groundwater in Guiyu. They found very high levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in both places. Lai Yun a campaigner for the group found over poisonous metals such as lead mercury and cadmium. Guiyu is only one example of digital dumps but similar places can be found across the world in Nigeria Ghana and India. Guiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal e waste recycling sites in the world however there are many sites worldwide including India Ghana Agbogbloshie Nigeria and the Philippines. Most research involving informal e waste recycling has been done in Guiyu but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in e waste workers the community and the environment. citation needed For example locals and migrant workers in Delhi a northern union territory of India scavenge discarded computer equipment and extract base metals using toxic unsafe methods. Bangalore located in southern India is often referred as the Silicon Valley of India and has a growing informal e waste recycling sector. A studies found that e waste workers in the slum community had higher levels of V Cr Mn Mo Sn Tl and Pb than workers at an e waste recycling facility. The processes of dismantling and disposing of electronic waste in developing countries led to a number of environmental impacts as illustrated in the graphic. Liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water groundwater soil and air and therefore in land and sea animals both domesticated and wild in crops eaten by both animals and human and in drinking water. One study of environmental effects in Guiyu China found the following A separate study at the Agbogbloshie e waste dump Ghana found a presence of lead levels as high as ppm in the soil. US EPA standard for lead in soil in play areas is ppm and ppm for non play areas. Scrap workers at the Agbogbloshie e waste dump regularly burn electronic components and auto harness wires for copper recovery releasing toxic chemicals like lead dioxins and furans into the environment. The environmental impact of the processing of different electronic waste components  E waste presents a potential security threat to individuals and exporting countries. Hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened exposing sensitive information. Credit card numbers private financial data account information and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local scams. Electronic files about government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multimillion dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the Defense Intelligence Agency DIA the Transportation Security Administration and Homeland Security have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie. Recycling is an essential element of e waste management. Properly carried out it should greatly reduce the leakage of toxic materials into the environment and mitigate against the exhaustion of natural resources. However it does need to be encouraged by local authorities and through community education. One of the major challenges is recycling the printed circuit boards from the electronic wastes. The circuit boards contain such precious metals as gold silver platinum etc. and such base metals as copper iron aluminum etc. One way e waste is processed is by melting circuit boards burning cable sheathing to recover copper wire and open pit acid leaching for separating metals of value. Conventional method employed is mechanical shredding and separation but the recycling efficiency is low. Alternative methods such as cryogenic decomposition have been studied for printed circuit board recycling and some other methods are still under investigation. Properly disposing of or reusing electronics can help prevent health problems reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs. Reuse and refurbishing offer a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative to downcycling processes. citation needed The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency encourages electronic recyclers to become certified by demonstrating to an accredited independent third party auditor that they meet specific standards to safely recycle and manage electronics. This should work so as to ensure the highest environmental standards are being maintained. Two certifications for electronic recyclers currently exist and are endorsed by the EPA. Customers are encouraged to choose certified electronics recyclers. Responsible electronics recycling reduces environmental and human health impacts increases the use of reusable and refurbished equipment and reduces energy use while conserving limited resources. The two EPA endorsed certification programs are Responsible Recyclers Practices R and E Stewards. Certified companies ensure they are meeting strict environmental standards which maximize reuse and recycling minimize exposure to human health or the environment ensure safe management of materials and require destruction of all data used on electronics. Certified electronics recyclers have demonstrated through audits and other means that they continually meet specific high environmental standards and safely manage used electronics. Once certified the recycler is held to the particular standard by continual oversight by the independent accredited certifying body. A certification board accredits and oversees certifying bodies to ensure that they meet specific responsibilities and are competent to audit and provide certification. Some U.S. retailers offer opportunities for consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices. In the US the Consumer Electronics Association CEA urges consumers to dispose properly of end of life electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs that use the strictest standards and third party certified recycling locations to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA research has found that percent of consumers know where to take their end of life electronics and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by a sharp increase from million pounds industry recycled in . The Sustainable Materials Management SMM Electronic Challenge was created by the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA in . Participants of the Challenge are manufacturers of electronics and electronic retailers. These companies collect end of life EOL electronics at various locations and send them to a certified third party recycler. Program participants are then able publicly promote and report responsible recycling for their companies. The Electronics TakeBack Coalition ETBC is a campaign aimed at protecting human health and limiting environmental effects where electronics are being produced used and discarded. The ETBC aims to place responsibility for disposal of technology products on electronic manufacturers and brand owners primarily through community promotions and legal enforcement initiatives. It provides recommendations for consumer recycling and a list of recyclers judged environmentally responsible. While there have been major benefits from the rise in recycling and waste collection created by producers and consumers such as valuable materials being recovered and kept away from landfill and incineration there are still many problems present with the EPR system including how to ensure proper enforcement of recycling standards what to do about waste with positive net value and the role of competition Kunz et al. . Many stakeholders agreed there needs to be a higher standard of accountability and efficiency to improve the systems of recycling everywhere as well as the growing amount of waste being an opportunity more so than downfall since it gives us more chances to create an efficient system. To make recycling competition more cost effective the producers agreed that there needs to be a higher drive for competition because it allows them to have a wider range of producer responsibility organizations to choose from for e waste recycling. The Certified Electronics Recycler program for electronic recyclers is a comprehensive integrated management system standard that incorporates key operational and continual improvement elements for quality environmental and health and safety performance. The grassroots Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition promotes human health and addresses environmental justice problems resulting from toxins in technologies. The World Reuse Repair and Recycling Association wra.org is an organization dedicated to improving the quality of exported electronics encouraging better recycling standards in importing countries and improving practices through Fair Trade principles. Take Back My TV is a project of The Electronics TakeBack Coalition and grades television manufacturers to find out which are responsible in the coalition s view and which are not. There have also been efforts to raise awareness of the potentially hazardous conditions of the dismantling of e waste in American prisons. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition prisoner rights activists and environmental groups released a Toxic Sweatshops report that details how prison labor is being used to handle e waste resulting in health consequences among the workers. These groups allege that since prisons do not have adequate safety standards inmates are dismantling the products under unhealthy and unsafe conditions. In many developed countries electronic waste processing usually first involves dismantling the equipment into various parts metal frames power supplies circuit boards plastics often by hand but increasingly by automated shredding equipment. A typical example is the NADIN electronic waste processing plant in Novi Iskar Bulgaria the largest facility of its kind in Eastern Europe. The advantages of this process are the human s ability to recognize and save working and repairable parts including chips transistors RAM etc. The disadvantage is that the labor is cheapest in countries with the lowest health and safety standards. In an alternative bulk system a hopper conveys material for shredding into an unsophisticated mechanical separator with screening and granulating machines to separate constituent metal and plastic fractions which are sold to smelters or plastics recyclers. Such recycling machinery is enclosed and employs a dust collection system. Some of the emissions are caught by scrubbers and screens. Magnets eddy currents and Trommel screens are employed to separate glass plastic and ferrous and nonferrous metals which can then be further separated at a smelter. Leaded glass from CRTs is reused in car batteries ammunition and lead wheel weights or sold to foundries as a fluxing agent in processing raw lead ore. Copper gold palladium silver and tin are valuable metals sold to smelters for recycling. Hazardous smoke and gases are captured contained and treated to mitigate environmental threat. These methods allow for safe reclamation of all valuable computer construction materials. Hewlett Packard product recycling solutions manager Renee St. Denis describes its process as We move them through giant shredders about feet tall and it shreds everything into pieces about the size of a quarter. Once your disk drive is shredded into pieces about this big it s hard to get the data off . An ideal electronic waste recycling plant combines dismantling for component recovery with increased cost effective processing of bulk electronic waste. Reuse is an alternative option to recycling because it extends the lifespan of a device. Devices still need eventual recycling but by allowing others to purchase used electronics recycling can be postponed and value gained from device use. Recycling raw materials from end of life electronics is the most effective solution to the growing e waste problem. Most electronic devices contain a variety of materials including metals that can be recovered for future uses. By dismantling and providing reuse possibilities intact natural resources are conserved and air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal is avoided. Additionally recycling reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products. Another benefit of recycling e waste is that many of the materials can be recycled and re used again. Materials that can be recycled include ferrous iron based and non ferrous metals glass and various types of plastic. Non ferrous metals mainly aluminum and copper can all be re smelted and re manufactured. Ferrous metals such as steel and iron also can be re used. Due to the recent surge in popularity in D printing certain D printers have been designed FDM variety to produce waste that can be easily recycled which decreases the amount of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere. The excess plastic from these printers that comes out as a byproduct can also be reused to create new D printed creations. Benefits of recycling are extended when responsible recycling methods are used. In the U.S. responsible recycling aims to minimize the dangers to human health and the environment that disposed and dismantled electronics can create. Responsible recycling ensures best management practices of the electronics being recycled worker health and safety and consideration for the environment locally and abroad. In Europe metals that are recycled are returned to companies of origin at a reduced cost. Through a committed recycling system manufacturers in Japan have been pushed to make their products more sustainable. Since many companies were responsible for the recycling of their own products this imposed responsibility on manufacturers requiring many to redesign their infrastructure. As a result manufacturers in Japan have the added option to sell the recycled metals. One of the factors which exacerbate the e waste problem is the diminishing lifetime of many electrical and electronic goods. There are two drivers in particular for this trend. On the one hand consumer demand for low cost products mitigates against product quality and results in short product lifetimes. On the other manufacturers in some sectors encourage a regular upgrade cycle and may even enforce it though restricted availability of spare parts service manuals and software updates or through planned obsolescence. Consumer dissatisfaction with this state of affairs has led to a growing repair movement. Often this is at a community level such as through repair caf s or the restart parties promoted by the Restart Project The Right to Repair is spearheaded in the US by farmers dissatisfied with non availability of service information specialised tools and spare parts for their high tech farm machinery. But the movement extends far beyond farm machinery with for example the restricted repair options offered by Apple coming in for criticism. Manufacturers often counter with safety concerns resulting from unauthorised repairs and modifications. Some computer components can be reused in assembling new computer products while others are reduced to metals that can be reused in applications as varied as construction flatware and jewellery. Substances found in large quantities include epoxy resins fiberglass PCBs PVC polyvinyl chlorides thermosetting plastics lead tin copper silicon beryllium carbon iron and aluminium. Elements found in small amounts include cadmium mercury and thallium. Elements found in trace amounts include americium antimony arsenic barium bismuth boron cobalt europium gallium germanium gold indium lithium manganese nickel niobium palladium platinum rhodium ruthenium selenium silver tantalum terbium thorium titanium vanadium and yttrium. Almost all electronics contain lead and tin as solder and copper as wire and printed circuit board tracks though the use of lead free solder is now spreading rapidly. The following are ordinary applications There is also evidence of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of some chemicals which have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation cause cell membrane lesion cause DNA single strand breaks and elevate Reactive Oxygen Species ROS levels. Residents living around the e waste recycling sites even if they do not involve in e waste recycling activities can also face the environmental exposure due to the food water and environmental contamination caused by e waste because they can easily contact to e waste contaminated air water soil dust and food sources. In general there are three main exposure pathways inhalation ingestion and dermal contact. Studies show that people living around e waste recycling sites have a higher daily intake of heavy metals and a more serious body burden. Potential health risks include mental health impaired cognitive function and general physical health damage. See also Electronic waste Hazardous DNA damage was also found more prevalent in all the e waste exposed populations i.e. adults children and neonates than the populations in the control area. DNA breaks can increase the likelihood of wrong replication and thus mutation as well as lead to cancer if the damage is to a tumor suppressor gene. Prenatal exposure to e waste has found to have adverse effects on human body burden of pollutants of the neonates. In Guiyu one of the most famous e waste recycling sites in China it was found that increased cord blood lead concentration of neonates was associated with parents participation in e waste recycling processes as well as how long the mothers spent living in Guiyu and in e waste recycling factories or workshops during pregnancy. Besides a higher placental metallothionein a small protein marking the exposure of toxic metals was found among neonates from Guiyu as a result of Cd exposure while the higher Cd level in Guiyu s neonates was related to the involvement in e waste recycling of their parents. High PFOA exposure of mothers in Guiyu is related to adverse effect on growth of their new born and the prepotency in this area. Prenatal exposure to informal e waste recycling can also lead to several adverse birth outcomes still birth low birth weight low Apgar scores etc. and longterm effects such as behavioral and learning problems of the neonates in their future life. Children are especially sensitive to e waste exposure because of several reasons such as their smaller size higher metabolism rate larger surface area in relation to their weight and multiple exposure pathways for example dermal hand to mouth and take home exposure . They were measured to have an time potential health risk compared to the adult e waste recycling workers. Studies have found significant higher blood lead levels BLL and blood cadmium levels BCL of children living in e waste recycling area compared to those living in control area. For example one study found that the average BLL in Guiyu was nearly . times compared to that in the control site . ug dL compared to . ug dL while the CDC of the United States has set a reference level for blood lead at ug dL. The highest concentrations of lead were found in the children of parents whose workshop dealt with circuit boards and the lowest was among those who recycled plastic. Exposure to e waste can cause serious health problems to children. Children s exposure to developmental neurotoxins containing in e waste such as lead mercury cadmium chromium and PBDEs can lead to a higher risk of lower IQ impaired cognitive function and other adverse effects. In certain age groups a decreased lung function of children in e waste recycling sites has been found. Some studies also found associations between children s e waste exposure and impaired coagulation hearing loss and decreased vaccine antibody tilters in e waste recycling area. The Occupational Safety Health Administration OSHA has summarized several potential safety hazards of recycling workers in general such as crushing hazards hazardous energy released and toxic metals.  OSHA has also specified some chemical components of electronics that can potentially do harm to e recycling workers health such as lead mercury PCBs asbestos refractory ceramic fibers RCFs and radioactive substances. Besides in the United States most of these chemical hazards have specific Occupational exposure limits OELs set by OSHA National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists ACGIH . For the details of health consequences of these chemical hazards see also Electronic waste Electronic waste substances. Informal e recycling industry refers to small e waste recycling workshops with few if any automatic procedures and personal protective equipment PPE . On the other hand formal e recycling industry refers to regular e recycling facilities sorting materials from e waste with automatic machinery and manual labor where pollution control and PPE are common. Sometimes formal e recycling facilities dismantle the e waste to sort materials then distribute it to other downstream recycling department to further recover materials such as plastic and metals. The health impact of e waste recycling workers working in informal industry and formal industry are expect to be different in the extent. Studies in three recycling sites in China suggest that the health risks of workers from formal e recycling facilities in Jiangsu and Shanghai were lower compared to those worked in informal e recycling sites in Guiyu. In another study of e waste recycling in India hair samples were collected from workers at an e waste recycling facility and an e waste recycling slum community informal industry in Bangalore. Levels of V Cr Mn Mo Sn Tl and Pb were significantly higher in the workers at the e waste recycling facility compared to the e waste workers in the slum community. However Co Ag Cd and Hg levels were significantly higher in the slum community workers compared to the facility workers. Even in formal e recycling industry workers can be exposed to excessive pollutants. Studies in the formal e recycling facilities in France and Sweden found workers overexposure compared to recommended occupational guidelines to lead cadmium mercury and some other metals as well as BFRs PCBs dioxin and furans. Workers in formal industry are also exposed to more brominated flame retardants than reference groups. For occupational health and safety of e waste recycling workers both employers and workers should take actions. Suggestions for the e waste facility employers and workers given by California Department of Public Health are illustrated in the graphic.

The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated therefore reducing the need for landfill space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Resource recovery delays the need to use raw materials in the manufacturing process. Materials found in municipal solid waste can be used to make new products. Plastic paper aluminium glass and metal are examples of where value can be found in waste. Resource recovery goes further than just the management of waste. Life cycle analysis LCA can be used to compare the resource recovery potential of different treatment technologies. Improvements to administration source separation and collection reuse and recycling are important. For example organic materials can be treated with anaerobic digestion and turned into energy compost or fertilizer. Resource recovery can also be an aim in the context of sanitation. Here the term refers to approaches to recover the resources that are contained in wastewater and human excreta urine and feces . The term toilet resources has come into use recently. Those resources include nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus organic matter energy and water. This concept is also referred to as ecological sanitation. Separation of waste flows can help make resource recovery simpler. Examples include keeping urine separate from feces as in urine diversion toilets and keeping greywater and blackwater separate in municipal wastewater systems. Recycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of disposed materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles or sorted directly from mixed waste streams. The most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage cans copper such as wire steel food and aerosol cans old steel furnishings or equipment polyethylene and PET bottles glass bottles and jars paperboard cartons newspapers magazines and light paper and corrugated fiberboard boxes. PVC LDPE PP and PS see resin identification code are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products such as computers and electronic equipment is more difficult due to the additional dismantling and separation required. The type of recycling material accepted varies by city and country. Each city and country have different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials. Valuable resources can be recovered from wastewater sewage sludge fecal sludge and human excreta. These include water energy and fertilizing nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium as well as micro nutrients such as sulphur and organic matter. There is also increasing interest for recovering other raw materials from wastewater such as bioplastics and metals such as silver. Originally wastewater systems were designed only to remove excreta and wastewater from urban areas. Water was used to flush away the waste often discharging into nearby waterbodies. Since the s there has been increasing interest in treating the wastewater to protect the environment and efforts focused primarily on cleaning the water at the end of the pipe. citation needed Since around the year the concepts of ecological sanitation and sustainable sanitation have emerged with the focus on recovering resources from wastewater. citation needed As of the term toilet resources came into use and encouraged more attention to the potential for resource recovery from toilets. The following resources can be recovered Other methods are also being developed for transforming wastewater into valuable products. Growing Black Soldier Flies in excreta or organic waste can produce fly larvae as a protein feed. Other researchers are harvesting fatty acids from wastewater to make bioplastics. Disposed materials that are organic in nature such as plant material food scraps and paper products can be recycled using biological composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition waste gas from the process such as methane can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat CHP cogeneration maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps to small town scale batch digesters industrial scale enclosed vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste see mechanical biological treatment . Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being aerobic or anaerobic methods though hybrids of the two methods also exist. Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste MSW has been found to be more environmentally effective than landfill incineration or pyrolysis. Life cycle analysis LCA was used to compare different technologies. The resulting biogas methane though must be used for cogeneration electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to hydrogen for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion.

Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being aerobic or anaerobic methods though hybrids of the two methods also exist. In many countries source separated curbside collection is one method of resource recovery. In Australia households are provided with several bins one for recycling yellow lid another for general waste usually a red lid and another for garden materials green lid . The garden recycling bin is provided by the municipality if requested. Some localities have dual stream recycling with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case the recovered materials are trucked to a materials recovery facility for further processing. Municipal commercial and industrial construction and demolition debris is dumped at landfills and some is recycled. Household disposal materials are segregated recyclables sorted and made into new products and unusable material is dumped in landfill areas. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics ABS the recycling rate is high and is increasing with of households reporting that they had recycled or reused within the past year survey up from in . citation needed In of materials from municipalities from commercial and industrial generators and from construction and demolition debris was recycled. Energy is produced is part of resource recovery as well some landfill gas is captured for fuel or electricity generation although this is considered the last resort as the point of resource recovery is avoidance of landfill disposal altogether. citation needed Resource recovery is a key component in a business ability to maintaining ISO accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year. One way to do this is by changing a company from a system of managing wastes to a resource recovery system such as recycling glass food waste paper and cardboard plastic bottles etc. Education and awareness in the area of resource recovery is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation and the depletion of natural resources. Local regional and global air pollution accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes destruction and depletion of forests soil and water depletion of the ozone layer and emission of green house gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity the security of nations and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and resource recovery programs. University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations e.g. WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their reverse vending machines to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include Tomra and Envipco. In CNBC aired the documentary Trash Inc The Secret Life of Garbage about waste what happens to it when it s thrown away and its impact on the world. Extended producer responsibility EPR is a pricing strategy that promotes integrating all costs associated with a given product throughout its life cycle. Having the market price also reflect the end of life disposal costs encourages more accuracy in pricing.

The International Energy Agency Bioenergy Task defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio based products food feed chemicals materials and bioenergy biofuels power and or heat . As refineries biorefineries can provide multiple chemicals by fractioning an initial raw material biomass into multiple intermediates carbohydrates proteins triglycerides that can be further converted into value added products. . Each refining phase is also referred to as a cascading phase . The use of biomass as feedstock can provide a benefit by reducing the impacts on the environment as lower pollutants emissions and reduction in the emissions of hazard products . In addition biorefineries are intended to achieve the following goals Biorefineries can be classified based in four main features The aforementioned features are used to classified biorefineries systems according to the following method Some examples of classifications are Techno economic assessment TEA is a methodology to evaluate whether a technology or process is economically attractive. TEA research has been developed to provide information about the performance of the biorefinery concept in diverse production systems as sugarcane mills biodiesel production pulp and paper mills and the treatment of industrial and municipal solids waste. Bioethanol plants and sugarcane mills are well established processes where the biorefinery concept can be implemented since sugarcane bagasse is a feasible feedstock to produce fuels and chemicals lignocellulosic bioethanol G is produced in Brazil in two plants with capacities of and Ml y about . of the production capacity in Brazil . TEA of ethanol production using mild liquefaction of bagasse plus simultaneous saccharification and co fermentation shows a minimum selling price between . and . US cents L which is comparable with the market price . The production of xylitol citric acid and glutamic acid from sugarcane lignocellulose bagasse and harvesting residues each in combination with electricity have been evaluated the three biorefinery systems were simulated to be annexed to an existing sugar mill in South Africa. The production of xylitol and glutamic acid has shown economic feasibility with an Internal Rate of Return IRR of . and . exceeding the IRR of the base case . . Likewise the production of ethanol lactic acid or methanol and ethanol lactic acid from sugarcane bagasse have been studied lactic acid demonstrated to be economically attractive by showing the greatest net present value M in the same way the production of ethanol and lactic acid as co product was found to be a favorable scenario net present value between M and M since this acid has applications in the pharmaceutical cosmetic chemical and food industry. As for biodiesel production this industry also has the potential to integrate biorefinery systems to convert residual biomasses and wastes into biofuel heat electricity and bio based green products . Glycerol is the main co product in biodiesel production and can be transformed into valuable products through chemocatalytic technologies the valorization of glycerol for the production of lactic acid acrylic acid allyl alcohol propanediols and glycerol carbonate has been evaluated all glycerol valorization routes shown to be profitable being the most attractive the manufacture of glycerol carbonate. Palm empty fruit bunches EFB are an abundant lignocellulosic residues from the palm oil biodiesel industry the conversion of this residue into ethanol heat and power and cattle feed were evaluated according to techno economic principles the scenarios under study shown reduced economic benefits although their implementation represented a reduction in the environmental impact climate change and fossil fuel depletion compared to the traditional biodiesel production. The economic feasibility for bio oil production from EFB via fast pyrolysis using the fluidized bed was studied crude bio oil can potentially be produced from EFB at a product value of . kg with a payback period and return on investment of . years and . respectively. The integration of microalgae and Jatropha as a viable route for the production of biofuels and biochemicals has been analyzed in the United Arab Emirates UAE context . Three scenarios were examined in all of them biodiesel and glycerol is produced in the first scenario biogas and organic fertilizer is produced by anaerobic fermentation of Jatropha fruit cake and seedcake the second scenario includes the production of lipids from jatropha and microalgae to produce biodiesel and the production of animal feed biogas and organic fertilizer the third scenario involves the production of lipids from microalgae for the production of biodiesel as well as hydrogen and animal feed as final product only the first scenario was profitable. In regard to the pulp and paper industry lignin is a natural polymer co generated and is generally used as boiler fuel to generate heat or steam to cover the energy demand in the process . Since lignin accounts for wt of the available lignocellulosic biomass and is equivalent to of its energy contents the economics of biorefineries depend on the cost effective processes to transform lignin into value added fuels and chemicals . The conversion of an existing Swedish kraft pulp mill to the production of dissolving pulp electricity lignin and hemicellulose has been studied self sufficiency in terms of steam and the production of excess steam was a key factor for the integration of a lignin separation plant in this case the digester has to be upgraded for preserving the same production level and represents of the total investment cost of conversion. The potential of using the kraft process for producing bioethanol from softwoods in a repurposed or co located kraft mill has been studied a sugar recovery higher than enables the process to be competitive for the production of ethanol from softwood. The repurposing of a kraft pulp mill to produce both Ethanol and dimethyl ether has been investigated in the process cellulose is separated by and an alkaline pretreatment and then is hydrolyzed and fermented to produce ethanol while the resulting liquor containing dissolved lignin is gasified and refined to dimethyl ether the process demonstrate to be self sufficient in terms of hot utility fresh steam demand but with a deficit of electricity the process can be feasible economically speaking but is highly dependent on the development of biofuel prices. The exergetic and economic evaluation for the production of catechol from lignin was performed to determine its feasibility the results showed that the total capital investment was . M based on the plant capacity of kg d of feedstock besides the catechol price was estimated to be t and the valorization ratio was found to be .. The high generation of waste biomass is an attractive source for conversion to valuable products several biorefinery routes has been proposed to upgrade waste streams in valuable products. The production of biogas from banana peel Musa paradisiaca under the biorefinery concept is a promissory alternative since is possible to obtain biogas and other co products including ethanol xylitol syngas and electricity this process also provides high profitability for high production scales . The economic assessment of the integration of organic waste anaerobic digestion with other mixed culture anaerobic fermentation technologies was studied the highest profit is obtained by dark fermentation of food waste with separation and purification of acetic and butyric acids USD t of foodwaste . The technical feasibility profitability and extent of investment risk to produce sugar syrups from food and beverage waste was analyzed the returns on investment shown to be satisfactory for the production of fructose syrup . HFS . and glucose rich syrup . the sugar syrups also have high cost competitiveness with relatively low net production costs and minimum selling prices. The valorization of municipal solid waste through integrated mechanical biological chemical treatment MBCT systems for the production of levulinic acid has been studied the revenue from resource recovery and product generation without the inclusion of gate fees is more than enough to out weigh the waste collection fees annual capital and operating costs. One of the main goals of biorefineries is to contribute to a more sustainable industry by the conservation of resources and by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Nevertheless other environmental impacts may be associated to the production of biobased products as land use change eutrophication of water the pollution of the environment with pesticides or higher energy and material demand that lead to environmental burdens . Life cycle assessment LCA is a methodology to evaluate the environmental load of a process from the extraction of raw materials to the end use. LCA can be used to investigate the potential benefits of biorefinery systems multiple LCA studies has been developed to analyse whether biorefineries are more environmentally friendly compared to conventional alternatives. Feedstock is one of the main sources of environmental impacts in the biofuel production the source of this impacts are related to the field operation to grow handle and transport the biomass to the biorefinery gate . Agricultural residues are the feedstock with the lowest environmental impact followed by lignocellulosic crops and finally by first generation arable crops although the environmental impacts are sensitive to factors such as crop management practices harvesting systems and crop yields . The production of chemicals from biomass feedstock has shown environmental benefits bulk chemicals from biomass derived feedstocks have been studied showing savings on non renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental assessment for G and G ethanol shows that these two biorefinery systems are able to mitigate climate change impacts in comparison to gasoline but higher climate change benefits are achieved with G ethanol production up to reduction . The conversion of palm empty fruit bunches into valuable products ethanol heat and power and cattle feed reduces the impact for climate change and fossil fuel depletion compared to the traditional biodiesel production but the benefits for toxicity and eutrophication are limited . Propionic acid produced by fermentation of glycerol leads to significant reduction of GHG emissions compared to fossil fuel alternatives however the energy input is double and the contribution to eutrophication is significantly higher The LCA for the integration of butanol from prehydrolysate in a Canadian Kraft dissolving pulp mill shows that the carbon footprint of this butanol may be lower compare to gasoline but is not as low as corn butanol lower than that of gasoline . The majority of the LCA studies for the valorization of food waste have been focused on the environmental impacts on biogas or energy production with only few on the synthesis of high value added chemicals hydroxymethylfurfural HMF has been listed as one of the top bio based chemicals by the US Department of Energy the LCA of eight food waste valorization routes for the production of HMF shows that the most environmentally favorable option uses less polluting catalyst AlCl and co solvent acetone and provides the highest yield of HMF . Cmol metal depletion and toxicity impacts marine ecotoxicity freshwater toxicity and human toxicity were the categories with the highest values.  The pulp and paper industry is considered as the first industrialized biorefinery system in this industrial process other co products are produced including tall oil rosin vanillin and lignosulfonates . Apart from these co products the system includes energy generation in for of steam and electricity to cover its internal energy demand and it has the potential to feed heat and electricity to the grid . This industry has consolidated as the highest consumer of biomass and uses not only wood as feedstock it is capable of processing agricultural waste as bagasse rice straw and corn stover . Other important features of this industry is a well established logistic for biomass production avoids competition with food production for fertile land and presents higher biomass yields . The fully operational Blue Marble Energy company has multiple biorefineries located in Odessa WA and Missoula MT.

"21",21,"municipal solid waste","/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste",TRUE,0,"waste|","Municipal solid waste MSW commonly known as trash or garbage in the United States and rubbish in Britain is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public","Municipal solid waste MSW commonly known as trash or garbage in the United States and rubbish in Britain is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. Garbage can also refer specifically to food waste as in a garbage disposal the two are sometimes collected separately. In the European Union the semantic definition is mixed municipal waste given waste code in the European Waste Catalog. Although the waste may originate from a number of sources that has nothing to do with a municipality the traditional role of municipalities in collecting and managing these kinds of waste have produced the particular etymology municipal. The composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from municipality to municipality and it changes significantly with time. In municipalities which have a well developed waste recycling system the waste stream mainly consists of intractable wastes such as plastic film and non recyclable packaging materials. At the start of the th century the majority of domestic waste in the UK consisted of coal ash from open fires. In developed areas without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes market wastes yard wastes plastic containers and product packaging materials and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential commercial institutional and industrial sources. Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include industrial wastes agricultural wastes medical waste radioactive waste or sewage sludge. Waste collection is performed by the municipality within a given area. The term residual waste relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for processing. Waste can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification The municipal solid waste industry has four components recycling composting disposal and waste to energy via incineration. There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams therefore the Environmental Protection Agency a U.S. federal government agency developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste. The Waste Management Hierarchy is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness Source reduction and reuse recycling or composting energy recovery treatment and disposal. The functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials but also the transport of these materials after collection to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility a transfer station or a landfill disposal site. Waste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source of collection. The types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside kerbside in the UK collection drop off and buy back centers. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility transfer stations combustion facilities and treatment plants. This element involves two main steps. First the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported usually over long distances to a processing or disposal site. Today the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site residual materials from materials recovery facilities MRFs residue from the combustion of solid waste compost or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety such as the problems of insects and the contamination of ground water. In the recent years environmental organizations such as Freegle or Freecycle Network have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore this free Internet based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the gift economy. Landfills are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full it is then sealed with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America. Landfills are regulated in the US by the Environmental Protection Agency which enforces standards provided in the Resource Conservation Recovery Act such as requiring liners and groundwater monitoring . This is because landfills pose the threat of pollution and can intoxicate ground water. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant. Municipal solid waste can be used to generate energy. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before including landfill gas capture combustion pyrolysis gasification and plasma arc gasification. While older waste incineration plants emitted a lot of pollutants recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern. United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulations in and under the Clean Air Act have succeeded in reducing emissions of dioxins from waste to energy facilities by more than percent below levels while mercury emissions have been reduced by over percent. The EPA noted these improvements in citing waste to energy as a power source with less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity .  ",FALSE
"22",22,"climate change","/wiki/Climate_change",FALSE,0,"null","Atmospheric physicsAtmospheric dynamics category","  Atmospheric physicsAtmospheric dynamics category Weather category portal Climate category Climate change category Climate change occurs when changes in Earth s climate system result in new weather patterns that last for at least a few decades and maybe for millions of years. The climate system comprises five interacting parts the atmosphere air hydrosphere water cryosphere ice and permafrost biosphere living things and lithosphere earth s crust and upper mantle . The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun with a relatively tiny amount from earth s interior. The climate system also gives off energy to outer space. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy and the passage of the energy through the climate system determines Earth s energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy earth s energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling. As this energy moves through Earth s climate system it creates Earth s weather and long term averages of weather are called climate . Changes in the long term average are called climate change . Such changes can be the result of internal variability when natural processes inherent to the various parts of the climate system alter Earth s energy budget. Examples include cyclical ocean patterns such as the well known El Nio Southern Oscillation and less familiar Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Climate change can also result from external forcing when events outside of the climate system s five parts nonetheless produce changes within the system. Examples include changes in solar output and volcanism. Human activities can also change earth s climate and are presently driving climate change through global warming. There is no general agreement in scientific media or policy documents as to the precise term to be used to refer to anthropogenic forced change either global warming or climate change may be used. The first describes the average effect on a global scale whilst the second describes how different geographical regions are affected differently. The field of climatology incorporates many disparate fields of research. For ancient periods of climate change researchers rely on evidence preserved in climate proxies such as ice cores ancient tree rings geologic records of changes in sea level and glacial geology. Physical evidence of current climate change covers many independent lines of evidence a few of which are temperature records the disappearance of ice and extreme weather events. The most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical properties principally its mean and spread of the climate system when considered over long periods of time regardless of cause. Accordingly fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades such as El Nio do not represent climate change. The term climate change is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change also known as global warming . Anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth s natural processes. In this sense especially in the context of environmental policy the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming. Within scientific journals global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas levels affect. A related term climatic change was proposed by the World Meteorological Organization WMO in to encompass all forms of climatic variability on time scales longer than years but regardless of cause. During the s the term climate change replaced climatic change to focus on anthropogenic causes as it became clear that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate. Climate change was incorporated in the title of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC . Climate change is now used as both a technical description of the process as well as a noun used to describe the problem. Prior to the th century scientists had not suspected that prehistoric climates were different from the modern period. By the late th century geologists found evidence of a succession of geological ages with changes in climate. In the years since a great deal of scientific progress has been made understanding the workings of the climate system. citation needed On the broadest scale the rate at which energy is received from the Sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of Earth. This energy is distributed around the globe by winds ocean currents and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions. Factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or forcing mechanisms . These include processes such as variations in solar radiation variations in the Earth s orbit variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents atmosphere and oceans mountain building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. There are a variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing. Some parts of the climate system such as the oceans and ice caps respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings while others respond more quickly. There are also key threshold factors which when exceeded can produce rapid change. Forcing mechanisms can be either internal or external . Internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself e.g. the thermohaline circulation . External forcing mechanisms can be either anthropogenic e.g. increased emissions of greenhouse gases and dust or natural e.g. changes in solar output the earth s orbit volcano eruptions . Whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external the response of the climate system might be fast e.g. a sudden cooling due to airborne volcanic ash reflecting sunlight slow e.g. thermal expansion of warming ocean water or a combination e.g. sudden loss of albedo in the Arctic Ocean as sea ice melts followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water . Therefore the climate system can respond abruptly but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longer. Scientists generally define the five components of earth s climate system to include atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere lithosphere restricted to the surface soils rocks and sediments and biosphere. Natural changes in the climate system result in internal climate variability . Examples include the type and distribution of species and changes in ocean atmosphere circulations. The ocean and atmosphere can work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time. Examples of this type of variability include the El Nio Southern Oscillation the Pacific decadal oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. These variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmosphere and or by altering the cloud water vapor sea ice distribution which can affect the total energy budget of the earth. The oceanic aspects of these circulations can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere and thus very high thermal inertia. For example alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the world s oceans. Due to the long timescales of this circulation ocean temperature at depth is still adjusting to effects of the Little Ice Age which occurred between the and s. Life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo evapotranspiration cloud formation and weathering. Examples of how life may have affected past climate include In the context of climate variation anthropogenic factors are human activities which affect the climate. The scientific consensus on climate change is that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities and it is largely irreversible . ... there is a strong credible body of evidence based on multiple lines of research documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned the core phenomenon scientific questions and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. Of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in CO levels. This is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion followed by aerosols particulate matter in the atmosphere and the CO released by cement manufacture. Other factors including land use ozone depletion animal husbandry ruminant animals such as cattle produce methane as do termites and deforestation are also of concern in the roles they play both separately and in conjunction with other factors in affecting climate microclimate and measures of climate variables. Slight variations in Earth s motion lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth s surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area averaged annually averaged sunshine but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of kinematic change are variations in Earth s eccentricity changes in the tilt angle of Earth s axis of rotation and precession of Earth s axis. Combined together these produce Milankovitch cycles which affect climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record. The IPCC notes that Milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles CO followed temperature change with a lag of some hundreds of years and that as a feedback amplified temperature change. The depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature thermal inertia on such scale . Upon seawater temperature change the solubility of CO in the oceans changed as well as other factors affecting air sea CO exchange. The Sun is the predominant source of energy input to the Earth. Other sources include geothermal energy from the Earth s core tidal energy from the Moon and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds. Both long and short term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate. Three to four billion years ago the Sun emitted only as much power as it does today. If the atmospheric composition had been the same as today liquid water should not have existed on Earth. However there is evidence for the presence of water on the early Earth in the Hadean and Archean eons leading to what is known as the faint young Sun paradox. Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist. Over the following approximately billion years the energy output of the Sun increased and atmospheric composition changed. The Great Oxygenation Event oxygenation of the atmosphere around . billion years ago was the most notable alteration. Over the next five billion years from the present the Sun s ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on Earth that survives until that time. Solar output varies on shorter time scales including the year solar cycle and longer term modulations. Solar intensity variations possibly as a result of the Wolf Sprer and the Maunder Minima are considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age. This event extended from to AD and was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward. Solar variation may also have affected some of the warming observed from to . The cyclical nature of the Sun s energy output is not yet fully understood it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the Sun as it ages and evolves. Some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects solar variation anthropogenic radiative forcings etc. . A study suggests that the effects of solar variability on temperature throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations . In CERN announced the initial results from its CLOUD experiment in the Nature journal. The results indicate that ionisation from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulfuric acid and water but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required this is insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours must be involved. The next step is to find more about these trace vapours including whether they are of natural or human origin. The eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the Earth s climate on a scale of more than year are the ones that inject over tons of SO into the stratosphere. This is due to the optical properties of SO and sulfate aerosols which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. On average such eruptions occur several times per century and cause cooling by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the Earth s surface for a period of several years. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the second largest terrestrial eruption of the th century affected the climate substantially subsequently global temperatures decreased by about . C . F for up to three years. Thus the cooling over large parts of the Earth reduced surface temperatures in the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of watts per square meter. The Mount Tambora eruption in caused the Year Without a Summer. Much larger eruptions known as large igneous provinces occur only a few times every years through flood basalts in Earth s past they have caused global warming and mass extinctions. Small eruptions with injections of less than . Mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere affect the atmosphere only subtly as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability. However because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency they too significantly affect Earth s atmosphere. Seismic monitoring maps current and future trends in volcanic activities and tries to develop early warning systems. In climate modelling the aim is to study the physical mechanisms and feedbacks of volcanic forcing. Volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle. Over very long geological time periods they release carbon dioxide from the Earth s crust and mantle counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks. The US Geological Survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities which generate times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes. A review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide including amounts released from mid ocean ridges volcanic arcs and hot spot volcanoes are only the equivalent of to days of human caused output. The annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions the most recent of which was the Toba eruption in Indonesia years ago. Although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere which itself is part of the climate system the IPCC explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent. Over the course of millions of years the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography. This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere ocean circulation. The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe and therefore in determining global climate. A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about million years ago which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover. During the Carboniferous period about to million years ago plate tectonics may have triggered large scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation. Geologic evidence points to a megamonsoonal circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons. The size of continents is also important. Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland. A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands. The Earth receives an influx of ionized particles known as cosmic rays from a variety of external sources including the Sun. A hypothesis holds that an increase in the cosmic ray flux would increase the ionization in the atmosphere leading to greater cloud cover. This in turn would tend to cool the surface. The non solar cosmic ray flux may vary as a result of a nearby supernova event the solar system passing through a dense interstellar cloud or the oscillatory movement of the Sun s position with respect to the galactic plane. The latter can increase the flux of high energy cosmic rays coming from the Virgo cluster. Evidence exists that the Chicxulub impact some million years ago had severely affected the Earth s climate. Large quantities of sulfate aerosols were kicked up into the atmosphere decreasing global temperatures by up to C and producing sub freezing temperatures for a period of years. The recovery time for this event took more than years. A number of disciplines throw light on past climates. Paleoclimatology is the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of the entire history of Earth. It uses a variety of proxy methods from the Earth and life sciences to obtain data previously preserved within things such as rocks sediments ice sheets tree rings corals shells and microfossils. It then uses the records to determine the past states of the Earth s various climate regions and its atmospheric system. Notable climate events known to paleoclimatology are provided in this list of periods and events in climate history. Historical climatology is the study of historical changes in climate and their effect on human history and development. The primary sources include written records such as sagas chronicles maps and local history literature as well as pictorial representations such as paintings drawings and even rock art. Climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes in settlement and agricultural patterns. Archaeological evidence oral history and historical documents can offer insights into past changes in the climate. Climate change effects have been linked to the rise and also the collapse of various civilizations. Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates. Reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid late th century. For earlier periods most of the evidence is indirect climatic changes are inferred from changes in proxies indicators that reflect climate such as vegetation ice cores dendrochronology sea level change and glacial geology. The instrumental temperature record from surface stations was supplemented by radiosonde balloons extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid th century and from the s on with global satellite data as well. Taking the record as a whole most of the th century had been unprecedentedly warm while the th and th centuries were quite cool. The O O ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories. Glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change. Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output. As temperatures warm glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt the converse is also true. Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings. Variability in temperature precipitation and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season. Therefore one must average over a decadal or longer time scale and or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate. A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the s initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites. This compilation tracks more than glaciers covering a total area of approximately km and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around km. The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance. From this data glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly with strong glacier retreats in the s stable or growing conditions during the s and s and again retreating from the mid s to the present. The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene approximately million years ago are the glacial and interglacial cycles. The present interglacial period the Holocene has lasted about years. Shaped by orbital variations responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea level changes helped create the climate. Other changes including Heinrich events Dansgaard Oeschger events and the Younger Dryas however illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing. Glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material including organic matter quartz and potassium that may be dated recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated. Similarly by tephrochronological techniques the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained. Data from NASA s Grace satellites show that the land ice sheets in both Antarctica upper chart and Greenland lower have been losing mass since . Both ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since . The decline in Arctic sea ice both in extent and thickness over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change. Sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface. It covers millions of square kilometers in the polar regions varying with the seasons. In the Arctic some sea ice remains year after year whereas almost all Southern Ocean or Antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually. Satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of . percent per decade relative to the to average. The Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented. Decades of shrinking and thinning in a warm climate has put the Arctic sea ice in a precarious position it is now vulnerable to atmospheric anomalies. Both extent and volume anomaly fluctuate little from January to July and then decrease steeply in August and September . This decrease is because of lessened ice production as a result of the unusually high SAT. During the Arctic summer a slower rate of sea ice production is the same as a faster rate of sea ice melting. Global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long term average. More recently altimeter measurements in combination with accurately determined satellite orbits have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change. To measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean coastal sediments marine terraces ooids in limestones and nearshore archaeological remains. The predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall. In the early Pliocene global temperatures were C warmer than the present temperature yet sea level was meters higher than today. According to recent studies global mean sea level rose by mm during the period from to . Since satellite based records indicate that there has been a further mm of global mean sea levels rise as of July update . Analysis of ice in a core drilled from an ice sheet such as the Antarctic ice sheet can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations. The air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the CO variations of the atmosphere from the distant past well before modern environmental influences. The study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in CO over many millennia and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions. Past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global network of precipitation gauges. Surface coverage over oceans and remote areas is relatively sparse but reducing reliance on interpolation satellite clouds and precipitation data has been available since the s. Quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments ice cores cave stalagmites and tree rings. In July scientists published evidence of increased cloud cover over polar regions as predicted by climate models. Climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation. For instance during the Last Glacial Maximum of years ago thermal driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low causing large areas of extreme desert including polar deserts cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation . In contrast the world s climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm Atlantic Period of years ago. Estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately over the course of the th century though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen complicated by ENSO and other oscillations including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the s and s than the later s and s despite the positive trend over the century overall. Similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived. A change in the type distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate. Some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne CO. The effects are expected to affect the rate of many natural cycles like plant litter decomposition rates. A gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms. Conversely cold will cause plant bio cycles to lag. Larger faster or more radical changes however may result in vegetation stress rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances. An example of this occurred during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse CRC an extinction event million years ago. At this time vast rainforests covered the equatorial region of Europe and America. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests abruptly fragmenting the habitat into isolated islands and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species. Such stress can alter the growth rate of trees which allows scientists to infer climate trends by analyzing the growth rate of tree rings. This branch of climate science is called dendroclimatology and is one of the many ways they research climate trends prior to written records. Even though this is a field with many uncertainties it is expected that over the next years climate changes will have an effect on the diversity of forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species or a population to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes drought pests diseases and forest fire. However species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations. To inhibit these problems human interventions such as transfer of forest reproductive material may be needed. Palynology is the study of contemporary and fossil palynomorphs including pollen. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes bogs or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities. These changes are often a sign of a changing climate. As an example palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the Quaternary glaciations and especially since the last glacial maximum. Remains of beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments. Different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions. Given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species and the age of the sediments in which remains are found past climatic conditions may be inferred. The studies of the impact in vertebrates are few mainly from developing countries where there are the fewest studies between and vertebrates declined by percent with freshwater marine and terrestrial populations declining by and percent respectively. Similarly the historical abundance of various fish species has been found to have a substantial relationship with observed climatic conditions. Changes in the primary productivity of autotrophs in the oceans can affect marine food webs. According to the IPCC human caused global warming is driving climate changes impacting both human and natural systems on all continents and across the oceans. Human caused global warming results from the increased use of fossil fuels in transportation manufacturing and communications. Internet induced climate change is newest contributor to human induced climate change. Some of the impacts include the altering of ecosystems with a few extinctions threat to food production and water supplies due to extreme weather and the dislocation of human communities due to sea level rise and other climate factors. Taken together these hazards also exacerbate other stressors such as poverty. Possible societal responses include efforts to prevent additional climate change adapting to unavoidable climate change and possible future climate engineering. ",FALSE

An EIP may also be planned designed and built in such a way that it makes it easier for businesses to co operate and that results in a more financially sound environmentally friendly project for the developer. The Eco industrial Park Handbook states that An Eco Industrial Park is a community of manufacturing and service businesses located together on a common property. Members seek enhanced environmental economic and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues. Based on the concepts of industrial ecology collaborative strategies not only include by product synergy waste to feed exchanges but can also take the form of wastewater cascading shared logistics and shipping receiving facilities shared parking green technology purchasing blocks multi partner green building retrofit district energy systems and local education and resource centres. This is an application of a systems approach in which designs and processes activities are integrated to address multiple objectives. EIPs can be developed as greenfield land projects where the eco industrial intent is present throughout the planning design and site construction phases or developed through retrofits and new strategies in existing industrial developments. Industrial symbiosis is a related but more limited concept in which companies in a region collaborate to utilize each other s by products and otherwise share resources. In Kalundborg Denmark a symbiosis network links a MW coal fired power plant with the community and other companies. Surplus heat from this power plant is used to heat local homes in addition to a nearby fish farm whose sludge is then sold as a fertilizer. Steam from the power plant is sold to Novo Nordisk a pharmaceutical and enzyme manufacturer in addition to a Statoil plant. This reuse of heat reduces the amount thermal pollution discharged to a nearby fjord. Additionally a by product from the power plant s sulfur dioxide scrubber contains gypsum which is sold to a wallboard manufacturer. Almost all of the manufacturer s gypsum needs are met this way which reduces the amount of open pit mining needed. Furthermore fly ash and clinker from the power plant is utilized for road building and cement production. The industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg was not created as a top down initiative but instead evolved gradually. As environmental regulations became stricter firms were motivated reduce the cost of compliance and turn their by products into economic products. In Canada eco industrial parks exist across the country and have enjoyed some success. The best known example is Burnside Park in Halifax Nova Scotia. With support from Dalhousie University s Eco Efficiency Centre the more than businesses have been improving their environmental performance and developing profitable partnerships. Subsequently two greenfield industrial developments have been started in Alberta TaigaNova Eco Industrial Park is in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands while Innovista Eco Industrial Park is a gateway to the Rocky Mountains km west of Edmonton. UNIDO Viet Nam United Nations Industrial Development Organization has compiled a list in of Eco Industrial Parks EIP in the ASEAN Economic Community in a report titled Economic Zones in the ASEAN written by Arnault Morisson. EIPs also refer to industrial parks where a green approach has been taken towards the infrastructure and development of the site. This can include green infrastructure related to Renewable Energy Systems stormwater groundwater and wastewater management road surfaces and transportation demand management. Green building practices can also be encouraged or mandated EIPs are often used as a stimulus for economic diversification in the community or region where they are located. Anchor tenants such as bio based product manufacturers or waste to energy facilities etc. can attract complementary businesses as suppliers scavengers recyclers service providers downstream users and other businesses that could benefit from eco industrial strategies. It is suggested that EIPs be used as a means of growing the renewable energy sector. In the case of a Solar Photovoltaic PV Manufacturing plant an EIP can increase the manufacturing efficiency to make it more economical while reducing the environmental impact of producing the solar cells.

"24",24,"resource productivity","/wiki/Resource_productivity",TRUE,0,"product|","Resource productivity is the quantity of good or service outcome that is obtained through the expenditure of unit resource","Resource productivity is the quantity of good or service outcome that is obtained through the expenditure of unit resource. This can be expressed in monetary terms as the monetary yield per unit resource. For example when applied to crop irrigation it is the yield of crop obtained through use of a given volume of irrigation water the crop per drop which could also be expressed as monetary return from product per use of unit irrigation water. Resource productivity and resource intensity are key concepts used in sustainability measurement as they attempt to decouple the direct connection between resource use and environmental degradation. Their strength is that they can be used as a metric for both economic and environmental cost. Although these concepts are two sides of the same coin in practice they involve very different approaches and can be viewed as reflecting on the one hand the efficiency of resource production as outcome per unit of resource use resource productivity and on the other hand the efficiency of resource consumption as resource use per unit outcome resource intensity . The sustainability objective is to maximize resource productivity while minimizing resource intensity. Scientific and political debates on resource productivity are regularly held at among others the World Resources Forum conferences.   ",FALSE
"25",25,"biomass","/wiki/Biomass",TRUE,0,"material|energy|material|process|product|","Biomass is plant or animal material used for energy production heat production or in various industrial processes as raw material for a range of products","Biomass is plant or animal material used for energy production heat production or in various industrial processes as raw material for a range of products. It can be purposely grown energy crops e.g. miscanthus switchgrass wood or forest residues waste from food crops wheat straw bagasse horticulture yard waste food processing corn cobs animal farming manure rich in nitrogen and phosphorus or human waste from sewage plants. Burning plant derived biomass releases CO but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the CO back into new crops. In some cases this recycling of CO from plants to atmosphere and back into plants can even be CO negative as a relatively large portion of the CO is moved to the soil during each cycle. Cofiring with biomass has increased in coal power plants because it makes it possible to release less CO without the cost associated with building new infrastructure. Co firing is not without issues however often an upgrade of the biomass is beneficiary. Upgrading to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods broadly classified as thermal chemical or biochemical see below . Historically humans have harnessed biomass derived energy since the time when people began burning wood fuel. Even in biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries. All biomass is biologically produced matter based in carbon hydrogen and oxygen. The estimated biomass production in the world is approximately billion metric tons of carbon per year about half in the ocean and half on land. Wood and residues from wood for instance spruce birch eucalyptus willow oil palm remains the largest biomass energy source today. It is used directly as a fuel or processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels. Biomass also includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fuel fibers or industrial chemicals. There are numerous types of plants including corn switchgrass miscanthus hemp sorghum sugarcane and bamboo. The main waste energy feedstocks are wood waste agricultural waste municipal solid waste manufacturing waste and landfill gas. Sewage sludge is another source of biomass. There is ongoing research involving algae or algae derived biomass. Other biomass feedstocks are enzymes or bacteria from various sources grown in cell cultures or hydroponics. Based on the source of biomass biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories First generation biofuels are derived from food sources such as sugarcane and corn starch. Sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce bioethanol an alcohol fuel which serve as an additive to gasoline or in a fuel cell to produce electricity. Second generation biofuels utilize non food based biomass sources such as perennial energy crops low input crops and agricultural municipal waste. There is huge potential for second generation biofuels but the resources are currently under utilized. Thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to upgrade biomass into a better and more practical fuel. The basic alternatives are torrefaction pyrolysis and gasification these are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature . There are other less common more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading. Some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass including aqueous slurries and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms. A range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms such as to produce a fuel that is more practical to store transport and use or to exploit some property of the process itself. Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal based processes such as the Fischer Tropsch synthesis. Biomass can be converted into multiple commodity chemicals. As biomass is a natural material many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed. In most cases microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process anaerobic digestion fermentation and composting. Glycoside hydrolases are the enzymes involved in the degradation of the major fraction of biomass such as polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thermostable variants are gaining increasing roles as catalysts in biorefining applications since recalcitrant biomass often needs thermal treatment for more efficient degradation. Biomass can be directly converted to electrical energy via electrochemical electrocatalytic oxidation of the material. This can be performed directly in a direct carbon fuel cell direct liquid fuel cells such as direct ethanol fuel cell a direct methanol fuel cell a direct formic acid fuel cell a L ascorbic Acid Fuel Cell vitamin C fuel cell and a microbial fuel cell. The fuel can also be consumed indirectly via a fuel cell system containing a reformer which converts the biomass into a mixture of CO and H before it is consumed in the fuel cell. On combustion the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide CO . After a period of time ranging from a few months to decades the CO produced from combustion is absorbed from the atmosphere by plants or trees. However the carbon storage capacity of forests may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed. All biomass crops sequester carbon. For example soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater below switchgrass crops than under cultivated cropland especially at depths below cm in . For Miscanthus x giganteus McCalmont et al. found accumulation rates ranging from . to . tonnes per hectare per year with a mean accumulation rate of . tonne . tonnes per acre per year or of total harvested carbon per year. The grass sequesters carbon in its continually increasing root biomass toghether with carbon input from fallen leaves. Typically perennial crops sequester more carbon than annual crops because the root buildup is allowed to continue undisturbed over many years. Also perennial crops avoid the yearly tillage procedures plowing digging associated with growing annual crops. Tilling induces soil aeration which accelerates the soil carbon decomposition rate by stimulating soil microbe populations. Also tilling makes it easier for the oxygen O atoms in the atmosphere to attach to carbon C atoms in the soil producing CO. The simple proposal that biomass is carbon neutral put forward in the early s has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular bioenergy project to be carbon neutral the total carbon sequestered by a bioenergy crop s root system must compensate for all the emissions from the related aboveground bioenergy project. This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect land use change. Many first generation bioenergy projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives. Transport fuels might be worse than solid fuels in this regard. Some are carbon neutral or even negative though especially perennial crops. The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG greenhouse gases emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a bio energy project is positive neutral or negative. Specifically a GHG carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the above ground total life cycle GHG emissions. Whitaker et al. estimates that for Miscanthus x giganteus carbon neutrality and even negativity is within reach. Basically the yield and related carbon sequestration is so high that it more than compensates for both farm operations emissions fuel conversion emissions and transport emissions. The graphic on the right displays two CO negative Miscanthus x giganteus production pathways represented in gram CO equivalents per megajoule. The yellow diamonds represent mean values. One should note that successful sequestration is dependent on planting sites as the best soils for sequestration are those that are currently low in carbon. The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact. Milner et al. argues that for the UK successful sequestration is expected for arable land over most of England and Wales with unsuccessful sequestration expected in parts of Scotland due to already carbon rich soils existing woodland . Also for Scotland the relatively lower yields in this colder climate makes CO negativity harder to achieve. Soils already rich in carbon includes peatland and mature forest. Grassland can also be carbon rich however Milner et al. further argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands. The bottom graphic displays the estimated yield necessary to achieve CO negativity for different levels of existing soil carbon saturation. Forest based biomass projects has received criticism for ineffective GHG mitigation from a number of environmental organizations including Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Environmental groups also argue that it might take decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by new trees. Biomass burning produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide volatile organic compounds particulates and other pollutants. In a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that two thirds of it had been principally produced by residential cooking and agricultural burning and one third by fossil fuel burning. The use of wood biomass as an industrial fuel has been shown to produce fewer particulates and other pollutants than the burning seen in wildfires or open field fires. ",FALSE

This includes a range of related ideas from environmentally friendly technological advances to socially acceptable innovative paths towards sustainability. The field of research that seeks to explain how why and at what rate new ecological ideas and technology spread is called eco innovation diffusion. The idea of eco innovation is fairly recent. One of the first appearances of the concept of eco innovation in the literature is in the book by Claude Fussler and Peter James. In a subsequent article Peter James defines eco innovation as new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts . Klaus Rennings introduces the term eco innovation addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development technological social and institutional innovation. Eco innovation is closely linked to a variety of related concepts. It is often used interchangeably with environmental innovation and is also often linked with environmental technology eco efficiency eco design environmental design sustainable design or sustainable innovation. While the term environmental innovation is used in similar contexts to eco innovation the other terms are mostly used when referring to product or process design and therefore focus more on the technological aspects of eco innovation rather than the societal or political aspects. Ecovation is the process by which responsible capitalism aligns with ecological innovation to construct products which have a generative nature and are recyclable back into the environment for usage in other industries. The most common usage of the term eco innovation is to refer to innovative products and processes that reduce environmental impacts. This is often used in conjunction with eco efficiency and eco design. Leaders in many industries have been developing innovative technologies in order to work towards sustainability. However these are not always practical or enforced by policy and legislation. Another position held for example by the organisation Eco Innovation is that this definition should be complemented eco innovations should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view this social pillar added to James s definition is necessary because it determines learning and the effectiveness of eco innovations. This approach gives eco innovations a social component a status that is more than a new type of commodity or a new sector even though environmental technology and eco innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches e.g. waste treatment recycling etc. . This approach considers eco innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco innovation a more integrated tool for sustainable development. Literature in the field of eco innovations often focuses on policy regulations technology market and firm specific factors rather than diffusion. However understanding of diffusion of eco innovations recently has gained more importance given the fact that some eco innovations are already at a mature stage. Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of eco innovations. At the same time adoption rates of solutions such as dynamic electricity tariffs remain unsatisfactorily low. The Not In My Back Yard NIMBY concept is often used to describe what at first seems to be a confusing intention behavior gap between high levels of public support for eco innovations and frequent non engagement or even local hostility towards specific project proposals. Social psychology and economic behavior models could and should be used to overcome these challenges.",FALSE
"27",27,"material efficiency","/wiki/Material_efficiency",TRUE,0,"material|metric|material|process|waste|description|","Material efficiency is a description or metric which expresses the degree in which raw materials are consumed incorporated or wasted as compared to previous measures in construction projects or physical processes","Material efficiency is a description or metric which expresses the degree in which raw materials are consumed incorporated or wasted as compared to previous measures in construction projects or physical processes. Making a usable item out of thinner stock than a prior version increases the material efficiency of the manufacturing process. Material efficiency goes hand in hand with Green building and Energy conservation as well as any other ways of incorporating Renewable resource s in the building process from start to finish. Material efficiency can also mean the degree in which a material can handle a particular load strain or weight upon it. Material efficiency can be achieved through using recycled materials materials that use renewable energy and other ways. For example using recycled steel instead of new steel reduces the energy produced in making the steel by percent and saves space in landfills as well. Material efficiency entails the pursuit of the technical strategies business models consumer preferences and policy instruments that would lead to a substantial reduction in the production of high volume energy intensive materials required to deliver human well being. The motivations for material efficiency include reducing energy demand reducing the emissions and other environmental impacts of industry and increasing national resource security. With a growing population and increasing wealth demand for material extraction and processing is likely to double in the next years. The environmental impacts of the required processing will become critical. Using materials that are more efficient in the building process today can be less expensive and energy intensive than using new building materials. An example of this would be using recycled steel to erect the frame of a building instead of using wooden timbers. Using recycled steel saves room in landfills that the steel would otherwise be taking up saves of the energy required to produce steel in the production process and saves trees from being cut down to build homes. The recycled steel can be fashioned in the exact dimensions needed for building and can be made into customized steel beams and panels to fit each specific design. These new more efficient materials can cost more initially when being used in building but in time will save money through lower heating cooling bills lower electric bills and other kinds of bills. Over time you can recoup your money and save even more all the while staying comfortable inside your home. There are three types of light bulbs today that are very popular Incandescent Light Bulbs Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs CFL s and Light Emitting Diodes LED s . Electric lighting alone can account for around of your current home energy bill. In addition to this only percent of the electricity used by an incandescent bulb generates light the rest is wasted. Here are two tables comparing the three types of lightbulbs   Another way to reduce electricity consumption and save money with lighting is by installing dimming switches with these bulbs. A dimmer can increase and decrease the amount of light emitted by the bulb to your liking. It can not make a light bulb brighter than its maximum already is but it can reduce it thus using less electricity and saving you money. Popular materials used for insulation are fiber glass rock wool and slag wool. After being manufactured these items require no energy to use and require no maintenance unless damaged. Using inflation properly is the most effective way to reduce energy use and green house gas emissions. Facts about today s insulation There is a new generation of insulation being released to the public recently. Plant based Polyurethane Rigid Foam is made from plants such as bamboo hemp and kelp that offers high moisture and heat resistance excellent acoustics and protection against mold and pests. It also has a higher R value than fiberglass or polystyrene meaning that it has a higher thermal resistance and insulates better. The hygroscopic properties of bio based insulation mean that they can absorb and store moisture from the surrounding air according to project partner Patricia Mara Prez Tarancn at Acciona Madrid Spain. The material behaves as a moisture buffer she says This softens the relative humidity changes in the environment reducing risks from common pollutants such as bacteria viruses chemical reactions allergies and respiratory infections as well as reducing the need for air conditioning. These plant based insulation techniques can be cheaper healthier save more energy in houses and buildings as well as cut energy consumption in the manufacturing process of insulation. Another more efficient way to cut energy consumption and save money along with newer plant based insulation is with proper roofing. Cool Roofing involves using roofing which direct sunlight back into the atmosphere instead of being absorbed by the material and being passed into the building. This Cool Roofing can save money by lowering the cost of keeping a building cool with air conditioners. The same process can be used to keep heat in and lower the cost of a heating bill. A cool roof is one that has been designed to reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat than a standard roof. Cool roofs can be made of a highly reflective type of paint a sheet covering or highly reflective tiles or shingles. Benefits of a Cool Roof Incorporating recycled materials into the manufacturing process of new goods is an integral change. Mineral resources are finite such as bauxite ore for aluminum or fossil fuels to make plastics so it is imperative to start reusing what we have already mined so that we do not deplete what is left. There are many technologies available that help tremendously with recycling efforts such as near infrared equipment which is a common sortation technology in large recycling operations and can accurately identify many different types of polymers. Near infrared equipment is a much easier way to sort through plastics compared to the human eye. Aluminum offers the most savings with cans from recycled material requiring as little as of the energy required to make the same cans from bauxite ore. Metals don t degrade as they re recycled in the same way plastics and paper do fibers shortening every cycle so many metals are prime candidates for recycling especially considering their high value per ton compared to other recyclables. Polystyrene from recycled material costs less than without recycling but a negligible amount of polystyrene is recycled in the United States because of the difficulty sorting it from other plastics. Other plastic products like polyethylene terephthalate soft drink bottles cost less to manufacture form recycled materials and this percentage as well as the variety of plastics that can be recycled is expected to increase with new separation technologies such as froth flotation and skin flotation. Nonetheless plastic degrades every time it s recycled so some plastic will always need to come directly from fossil oils if such products are to continue to be produced. Paper in particular newspaper and glass have lower energy savings than the previous materials with recycled products costing and less energy respectively. Recycled paper has a large market in China although work still needs to be done to facilitate mixed paper recycling as opposed to newspaper. If we were to utilize these recycling methods we would not have to expend energy and resources on mining for new resources to use in manufacturing. Recycled aluminum for example has the same properties as newly manufactured aluminum but expends so much less energy in the manufacturing process. This is assuming however that recycling plants are being run in the most efficient ways possible. Reusing current materials uses even less energy than recycling. Reusing is preferred to recycling because it eliminates the cost of transport to a recycling plant sorting re manufacturing distributing and there are no wages needed to be paid to employees for doing these tasks. Reusable containers only have to be manufactured once for hundreds or thousands of uses such as a water bottle used every day for years and the energy cost between uses is approximately that of cleaning the container with soap and water a negligible expense compared to sorting melting down and pouring the material into a mold again for example. Reusing containers could in theory replace recyclable containers and one use containers if made out of a durable enough material. There are inconveniences that go along with reusing materials however. Some of these inconveniences include having to clean the containers between uses carrying around full or empty containers and they require a time commitment due to having to hold on to them instead of throwing them away. For products with glass containers a deposit refund system to encourage people to return the containers to the store for reuse seems more useful than recycling given glass s durability and the small energy savings for recycling it. Reuse doesn t work as well for printed paper or for non container metal or plastic items such as electronics or packing material so recycling may still be the best option in these cases.",FALSE
"28",28,"sharing economy","/wiki/Sharing_economy",TRUE,0,"model|model|product|","Sharing economy is a term for a way of distributing goods and services a way that differs from the traditional model of corporations hiring employees and selling products to consumers","Sharing economy is a term for a way of distributing goods and services a way that differs from the traditional model of corporations hiring employees and selling products to consumers. In the sharing economy individuals are said to rent or share things like their cars homes and personal time to other individuals in a peer to peer fashion. There are two main types of sharing economy enterprises In commercial applications the sharing economy can be more of an ideology or marketing strategy than an actual economic model for example the company Airbnb is described as a sharing economy platform for individuals to share extra space in their homes but in reality the space is rented not shared and Airbnb listings are mostly owned by property management corporations. The sharing economy is also known as the access economy peer to peer PP economy gig economy or collaborative economy . The sharing economy is related to the circular economy which aims to minimize waste and which includes co operatives co creation recycling upcycling re distribution and trading used goods. It is also closely related to collaborative consumption in which an item is consumed by multiple people. Sharing might include sharing bartering lending trading renting gifting and swapping redefined through technology and peer communities. Other examples include exchanging collective purchasing shared ownership shared value borrowing and subscription based models. Commercial implementations encompass a wide range of structures including mostly for profit and to a lesser extent co operative structures. The sharing economy provides expanded access to products services and talent beyond one to one or singular ownership which is sometimes referred to as disownership . Individuals actively participate as users providers lenders or borrowers in varied and evolving peer to peer exchange schemes. In an article in Harvard Business Review authors Giana M. Eckhardt and Fleura Bardhi argue that sharing economy is a misnomer and that the correct term for this activity is access economy. The authors say When sharing is market mediated when a company is an intermediary between consumers who don t know each other it is no longer sharing at all. Rather consumers are paying to access someone else s goods or services. The article states that companies such as Uber that understand this and whose marketing highlights the financial benefits to participants are successful while companies such as Lyft whose marketing highlights the social benefits of the service are less successful. This insight that it is an access economy rather than a sharing economy has important implications for how companies in this space compete. It implies that consumers are more interested in lower costs and convenience than they are in fostering social relationships with the company or other consumers.....The access economy is changing the structure of a variety of industries and a new understanding of the consumer is needed to drive successful business models. A successful business model in the access economy will not be based on community however as a sharing orientation does not accurately depict the benefits consumers hope to receive. It is important to highlight the benefits that access provides in contrast to the disadvantages of ownership and sharing. The notion of sharing economy has often been considered an oxymoron and a misnomer for actual commercial exchanges. Arnould and Rose proposed to replace the misleading term sharing with mutualism or mutualization. A distinction can be made between free mutualization such as genuine sharing and for profit mutualization such as Uber Airbnb and Taskrabbit. According to George Ritzer this trend towards increased consumer input in commercial exchanges refers to the notion of prosumption which as such is not new. The mutualization of resources is for example well known in business to business BB like heavy machinery in agriculture and forestry as well as in business to consumer BC like self service laundry. But three major drivers enable consumer to consumer CC mutualization of resources for a broad variety of new goods and services as well as new industries. First customer behaviour for many goods and services changes from ownership to sharing. Second online social networks and electronic markets more easily link consumers. And third mobile devices and electronic services make the use of shared goods and services more convenient. For example smartphone key entry technology makes sharing an apartment easier compared to using physical keys. The escrow like model practiced by several of the largest sharing economy platforms which facilitate and handle contracting and payments on behalf of their subscribers further underlines an emphasis on access and transaction rather than on sharing. Michael Bauwens notes that companies such as Uber aren t operating by a peer to peer structure saying A sharing economy by definition is lateral in structure. It is a peer to peer economy. But Uber as its name suggests is hierarchical in structure. It monitors and controls its drivers demanding that they purchase services from it while guiding their movements and determining their level of earnings. And its pricing mechanisms impose unpredictable costs on its customers extracting greater amounts whenever the data suggests customers can be compelled to pay them. This is a top down economy not a shared one. While some successful platforms such as Airbnb or CanYa involve the sharing of a resource the term sharing economy has been widely criticised as being misleading. As an economic model the access economy suggests that access to goods and services may become more desirable than ownership of goods. Steve Denning notes The third thing that the Internet did was social. It created a generation of people who began doing something that cut to the heart of the way society has been organized for several hundred years. These people mainly young began preferring access to ownership. Instead of planning their lives on the premise of acquiring and owning more private property this new generation began finding meaning and satisfaction in having access to things and interacting with other people in the process. A common premise is that when information about goods is shared typically via an online marketplace the value of those goods may increase for the business for individuals for the community and for society in general. Many state local and federal governments are engaged in open data initiatives and projects such as data.gov and the London Data Store. The theory of open or transparent access to information enables greater innovation and makes for more efficient use of products and services and thus supporting resilient communities. In many cases the sharing economy relies on the will of the users to share but in order to make an exchange users have to overcome stranger danger. Access economy organizations say they are committed to building and validating trusted relationships between members of their community including producers suppliers customers or participants. Beyond trusting others i.e. the peers the users of a sharing economy platform also have to trust the platform itself as well as the product at hand. Unused value refers to the time over which products services and talents lay idle. This idle time is wasted value that business models and organizations that are based on sharing can potentially utilize. The classic example is that the average car is unused of the time. This wasted value can be a significant resource and hence an opportunity for sharing economy car solutions. There is also significant unused value in wasted time as articulated by Clay Shirky in his analysis of power of crowds connected by information technology. Many people have unused capacity in the course of their day. With social media and information technology such people can donate small slivers of time to take care of simple tasks that others need doing. Examples of these crowdsourcing solutions include the for profit Amazon Mechanical Turk and the non profit Ushahidi. Waste is commonly considered as something that is no longer wanted and needs to be discarded. The challenge with this point of view is that much of what we define as waste still has value that with proper design and distribution can safely serve as nutrients for follow on processes unlocking new levels of value in increasingly scarce and expensive resources. One example is heirloom design as articulated by physicist and inventor Saul Griffith. Several key macro developments led to the growth in the sharing. The sharing economy results from several deep seated technological economic political and societal changes The business model of companies situated in the gig economy has been criticised for using technology to evade worker protections such as rights to minimum wages and paid leave and disguising employment relationships as independent contracting self employment in order to shift costs onto workers. For example a study by the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute accused Uber of creatively leveraging the advantages of its dispatch system in order to evade traditional labour regulations and other inconvenient taxes and regulations . While in traditional industries workers may enjoy the benefits of trade unions healthcare provision minimum wage contract termination and working hours rights employees within the sharing economy are often paid as freelancers. Freelancers do not receive pension benefits or other employee rights and benefits and are often not paid on an hourly basis. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute concluded that across America and England there were a total of million people that were involved in some type of independent work. Moreover their payment is linked to the gigs they perform which could be deliveries rentals or other services. In some jurisdictions legal rulings have classified full time freelancers working for a single main employer of the gig economy as workers and awarded them regular worker rights and protection. An example is the October ruling against Uber in the case of Uber BV v Aslam which supported the claim of two Uber drivers to be classified as workers and to receive the related worker rights and benefits. It is important to distinguish employment in the sharing economy from employment through zero hour contracts a term primarily used in the United Kingdom. Employment in the gig economy entails receiving compensation for one key performance indicator which for example is defined as parcels delivered or taxi lifts conducted. Another feature is that employees can opt to refuse taking an order. Although employers do not have to guarantee employment or employees can also refuse to take an order under a zero hour contract workers under such a contract are paid by the hour and not directly through business related indicators as in the case of the gig economy. One inspiration for the sharing economy was the tragedy of the commons which refers to the idea that when we all act solely in our self interest we deplete the shared resources we need for our own quality of life. The Harvard law professor Yochai Benkler one of the earliest proponents of open source software posited that network technology could mitigate this issue through what he called commons based peer production a concept first articulated in . Benkler then extended that analysis to shareable goods in Sharing Nicely On Shareable goods and the emergence of sharing as a modality of economic production written in . The term sharing economy began to appear around the time of the Great Recession enabling social technologies and an increasing sense of urgency around global population growth and resource depletion. Professor Lawrence Lessig was possibly first to use the term in though others claim the origin of the term is unknown. As of according to a Pew Research Center survey only of Americans had heard of the term sharing economy . Survey respondents who had heard of the term had divergent views on what it meant with many thinking it concerned sharing in the traditional sense of the term. Many people thought it made sense for regular consumers not to buy their own power drill a tool that many consumers might use for only a few minutes in their lifetime but to borrow from others instead and that this borrowing could be facilitated by online platforms. Several startups were launched to help people share drills and similar goods along these lines. However it was clear that consumers were not interested in such temporary exchanges leading to the failure of many startups which aimed to facilitate traditional sharing. The term collaborative consumption was coined by Marcus Felson and Joe L. Spaeth in their paper Community Structure and Collaborative Consumption A routine activity approach published in in the American Behavioral Scientist. In collaborative consumption was named one of TIME magazine s ideas that will change the world. A June study using bibliometrics and network analysis analyzed the evolution of scholarly research on collaborative consumption and identified that this expression started in with Botsman and Rogers book What s mine is yours The rise of collaborative consumption . The number of studies published on the subject then increased exponentially in . Furthermore there are four clusters of research exploration and conceptualization of collaborative consumption consumer behavior and marketing empiricism mutualization and sharing systems sustainability in the collaborative economy. The analysis suggests that this last cluster was under researched in contrast to the three others but has started to increase in importance since . in its Budget the UK Government set out objectives to improve economic growth including to make Britain the ...best place in the world to start invest in and grow a business including through a package of measures to help unlock the potential of the sharing economy... Also in The Business of Sharing by Alex Stephany CEO of JustPark was published by Palgrave Macmillan. The book features interviews with high profile entrepreneurs such as Martin Varsavsky and venture capitalists such as Fred Wilson. According to a report by the United States Department of Commerce in June quantitative research on size and growth of the sharing economy remains sparse. Growth estimates can be challenging to evaluate due to different and sometimes unspecified definitions about what sort of activity counts as sharing economy transactions. The report noted a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers which looked at five components of the sharing economy travel car sharing finance staffing and streaming. It found that global spending in these sectors totalled about billion in which was only about of the total spending in those areas. The report also forecasted a possible increase of sharing economy spending in these areas to billion by which would be about of the total spending in these five areas. A PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that nearly one fifth of American consumers partake in some type of sharing economy activity. A report by Diana Farrell and Fiona Greig suggested that at least in the US sharing economy growth may have peaked. A December study ordered by the European Commission indicated that the volume of PP transactions in the EU across five sectors sales of goods accommodation rentals goods sharing odd jobs and ridesharing totaled . billion in . In China the sharing economy doubled in reaching . trillion yuan billion in transaction volume and was expected to grow by per year on average over the next few years according to the country s State Information Center. In an estimated million people used sharing economy platforms. According to TIARCENTER and the Russian Association of Electronic Communications eight key verticals of Russia s sharing economy CC sales odd jobs car sharing carpooling accommodation rentals shared offices crowdfunding and goods sharing grew to billion rubles . billion in . Collaborative consumption as a phenomenon is a class of economic arrangements in which participants mutualize access to products or services in addition to finding original ways to individual ownership. The phenomenon stems from consumers increasing desire to be in control of their consumption instead of passive victims of hyperconsumption . The collaborative consumption model is used in online marketplaces such as eBay as well as emerging sectors such as social lending peer to peer accommodation peer to peer travel experiences peer to peer task assignments or travel advising and carsharing or commuting bus sharing. Collaborative consumption refers to resource circulation systems which allow a consumer two sided role in which consumers may act as both providers of resources or obtainers of resources. The exchange may be performed directly on a peer to peer basis or indirectly through an intermediary online or offline for free or for other compensation ex. money points services etc. . This vision allows for a broader understanding of the sharing economy based on the overarching criteria of consumers changing role capacity. Originally in Botsman and Rogers identified three resource circulation systems within collaborative consumption i.e. the sharing economy product service systems redistribution markets and collaborative lifestyles. Product service systems refer to commercial peer to peer mutualization systems CPMS allowing consumers to engage in monetized exchanges through Social peer to peer processes for temporary access to goods. Goods that are privately owned can be shared or rented out via peer to peer marketplaces. For example BMW s DriveNow established in is a car rental service that offers an alternative to owning a car. Users can access a car when and where they need one and pay for their usage by the minute. A system of collaborative consumption is based on used or pre owned goods being passed on from someone who does not want them to someone who does want them. This is another alternative to the more common reduce reuse recycle repair methods of dealing with waste. In some markets the goods may be free as on The Freecycle Network Zwaggle or Kashless.org. In others the goods are swapped as on Swap.com or sold for cash as on eBay craigslist and uSell . Collaborative lifestyles refer to community based platforms allowing consumers to engage in monetized exchanges through Social peer to peer processes for services or access to resources such as money or skills. These systems are based on people with similar needs or interests banding together to mutualize and exchange less tangible assets such as time space skills and money. The growth of mobile technology provides a platform to enable location based GPS technology and to also provide real time sharing. Suggested benefits of the sharing economy include Encompassing many of the listed benefits of the sharing economy is the idea of the freelance worker. Through monetizing unused assets such as renting out a spare guest room on Airbnb or providing personal services to others such as becoming a driver with Uber people are in effect becoming freelance workers. Freelance work entails better opportunity for employment as well as more flexibility for workers as people have the ability to pick and choose the time and place of their work. As freelance workers people can plan around their existing schedules and maintain multiple jobs if needed. Evidence of the appeal to this type of work can be seen from a survey conducted by the Freelancers Union which shows that around of the U.S. population is involved in freelance work. According to an article by Margarita Hakobyan freelance work can also be beneficial for small businesses. During their early developmental stages many small companies can t afford or aren t in need of full time departments but rather require specialized work for a certain project or for a short period of time. With freelance workers offering their services in the sharing economy firms are able to save money on long term labor costs and increase marginal revenue from their operations. Researcher Christopher Koopman an author of a which study by George Mason University economists said the sharing economy allows people to take idle capital and turn them into revenue sources. He has stated People are taking spare bedroom s cars tools they are not using and becoming their own entrepreneurs. Arun Sundararajan a New York University economist who studies the sharing economy told a congressional hearing that this transition will have a positive impact on economic growth and welfare by stimulating new consumption by raising productivity and by catalyzing individual innovation and entrepreneurship . A study in Intereconomics The Review of European Economic Policy noted that the sharing economy has the potential to bring many benefits for the economy while noting that this presupposes that the success of sharing economy services reflects their business models rather than regulatory arbitrage from avoiding the regulation that affects traditional businesses.

The research concluded that the Airbnb rates were lower than the hotel rates in six of the eight cities by a factor of . Data from a separate study shows that with Airbnb s entry into the market in Austin Texas hotels were required to lower prices by percent to keep up with Airbnb s lower prices. UberEATS allows users to order food and register to be UberEATS drivers. Similar to Uber drivers UberEATS drivers get paid for delivering food. An example of grocery delivery in sharing economy is Instakart. It has the same business model as that of sharing economy based companies like Uber Airbnb or CanYa. Instacart uses resources that are readily available and the shoppers shop at existing grocery shops. The contract workers use their personal vehicles to deliver groceries to customers. Instacart manages to keep its cost low as it does not require any infrastructure to store goods. In addition to having contract workers Instacart allows signing up to be a personal shopper for Instacart through its official web page. Oxford Internet Institute Economic Geographer Graham has argued that key parts of the sharing economy impose a new balance of power onto workers. By bringing together workers in low and high income countries gig economy platforms that are not geographically confined can bring about a race to the bottom for workers. New York Magazine wrote that the sharing economy has succeeded in large part because the real economy has been struggling. Specifically in the magazine s view the sharing economy succeeds because of a depressed labor market in which lots of people are trying to fill holes in their income by monetizing their stuff and their labor in creative ways and in many cases people join the sharing economy because they ve recently lost a full time job including a few cases where the pricing structure of the sharing economy may have made their old jobs less profitable e.g. full time taxi drivers who may have switched to Lyft or Uber . The magazine writes that In almost every case what compels people to open up their homes and cars to complete strangers is money not trust. ... Tools that help people trust in the kindness of strangers might be pushing hesitant sharing economy participants over the threshold to adoption. But what s getting them to the threshold in the first place is a damaged economy and harmful public policy that has forced millions of people to look to odd jobs for sustenance. Uber s audacious plan to replace human drivers may increase job loss as even freelance driving will be replaced by automation. However in a report published in January Carl Benedikt Frey found that while the introduction of Uber had not led to jobs being lost but had caused a reduction in the incomes of incumbent taxi drivers of almost . Frey found that the sharing economy and Uber in particular has had substantial negative impacts on workers wages. Some people believe the Great Recession led to the expansion of the shared economy because job losses enhanced the desire for temporary work which is prevalent in the sharing economy. However there are disadvantages to the worker when companies use contract based employment the advantage for a business of using such non regular workers is obvious It can lower labor costs dramatically often by percent since it is not responsible for health benefits social security unemployment or injured workers compensation paid sick or vacation leave and more. Contract workers who are barred from forming unions and have no grievance procedure can be dismissed without notice . There is debate over the status of the workers within the sharing economy whether they should be treated as independent contractors or employees of the companies. This issue seems to be most relevant among sharing economy companies such as Uber. The reason this has become such a big issue is that the two types of workers are treated very differently. Contract workers are not guaranteed any benefits and pay can be below average. However if they are employees they are granted access to benefits and pay is generally higher. The California Public Utilities Commission filed a case later settled out of court that addresses the same underlying issue seen in the contract worker controversy whether the new ways of operating in the sharing economy model should be subject to the same regulations governing traditional businesses . Like Uber Instakart too had to face similar lawsuits. In a lawsuit was filed against Instakart alleging the company misclassified a person who buys and delivers groceries as independent contractor. Instakart had to eventually make all such people as part time employees and had to accord benefits such as health insurance to those qualifying. This led to Instakart having thousands of employees overnight from zero. A article by economists at George Mason University argued that many of the regulations circumvented by sharing economy businesses are exclusive privileges lobbied for by interest groups. Workers and entrepreneurs not connected to the interest groups engaging in this rent seeking behavior are thus restricted from entry into the market. For example taxi unions lobbying a city government to restrict the number of cabs allowed on the road prevents larger numbers of drivers from entering in the marketplace. The same research finds that while access economy workers do lack the protections that exist in the traditional economy many of them cannot actually find work in the traditional economy. In this sense they are taking advantage of opportunities which the traditional regulatory framework has not been able to provide for them. As the sharing economy grows governments at all levels are reevaluating how to adjust their regulatory schemes to accommodate these workers. Andrew Leonard Evgeny Morozov Bernard Marszalek Dean Baker and Andrew Keen criticized the for profit sector of the sharing economy writing that sharing economy businesses extract profits from their given sector by successfully making an end run around the existing costs of doing business taxes regulations and insurance. Similarly In the context of online freelancing marketplaces there have been worries that the sharing economy could result in a race to the bottom in terms or wages and benefits as millions of new workers from low income countries come online. Susie Cagle wrote that the benefits big sharing economy players might be making for themselves are not exactly trickling down and that the sharing economy doesn t build trust because where it builds new connections it often replicates old patterns of privileged access for some and denial for others . William Alden wrote that The so called sharing economy is supposed to offer a new kind of capitalism one where regular folks enabled by efficient online platforms can turn their fallow assets into cash machines ... But the reality is that these markets also tend to attract a class of well heeled professional operators who outperform the amateurs just like the rest of the economy . The local economic benefit of the sharing economy is offset by its current form which is that huge tech companies reap a great deal of the profit in many cases. For example Uber which is estimated to be worth B as of mid takes up to commission from the gross revenue of its drivers leaving many drivers making less than minimum wage. This is reminiscent of a peak Rentier state which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues from the rent of indigenous resources to external clients . The impacts of the access economy in terms of costs wages and employment are not easily measured and appear to be growing. Various estimates indicate that of the U.S. workforce is self employed part time temporary or freelancers. However the exact percentage of those performing short term tasks or projects found via technology platforms was not effectively measured as of by government sources. In the U.S. one private industry survey placed the number of full time independent workers at . million in roughly the same as . Another survey estimated the number of workers who do at least some freelance work at . million in roughly of the workforce and up slightly from . Economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger wrote in March that there is a trend towards more workers in alternative part time or contract work arrangements rather than full time the percentage of workers in such arrangements rose from . in to . in late . Katz and Krueger defined alternative work arrangements as temporary help agency workers on call workers contract company workers and independent contractors or free lancers . They also estimated that approximately . of all workers identify customers through an online intermediary this was consistent with two others studies that estimated the amount at . and . . At the individual transaction level the removal of a higher overhead business intermediary say a taxi company with a lower cost technology platform helps reduce the cost of the transaction for the customer while also providing an opportunity for additional suppliers to compete for the business further reducing costs. Consumers can then spend more on other goods and services stimulating demand and production in other parts of the economy. Classical economics argues that innovation that lowers the cost of goods and services represents a net economic benefit overall. However like many new technologies and business innovations this trend is disruptive to existing business models and presents challenges for governments and regulators. For example should the companies providing the technology platform be liable for the actions of the suppliers in their network Should persons in their network be treated as employees receiving benefits such as healthcare and retirement plans If consumers tend to be higher income persons while the suppliers are lower income persons will the lower cost of the services and therefore lower compensation of the suppliers worsen income inequality These are among the many questions the on demand economy presents. Using a personal car to transport passengers or deliveries requires payment or sufferance of costs for fees deducted by the dispatching company fuel wear and tear depreciation interest taxes as well as adequate insurance. The driver is typically not paid for driving to an area where fares might be found in the volume necessary for high earnings or driving to the location of a pickup or returning from a drop off point. Mobile apps have been written that help a driver be aware of and manage such costs has been introduced. Uber Airbnb and other companies have had drastic effects on infrastructures such as road congestion and housing. Major cities such as San Francisco and New York City have arguably become more congested due to their use. According to transportation analyst Charles Komanoff Uber caused congestion has reduced traffic speeds in downtown Manhattan by around percent . The percentage of seniors in the work force has increased from . in to . in an increase in part attributed to the rise of the access economy. As a response to the fast changing nature of working practices in the modern economy especially temporary work The UK Government has carried out a review and issued guidelines in an attempt to address these issues. The report was published on the th July and the overriding conclusion was that the UK s economy should be fair and decent . A point plan was suggested to improve working conditions and security. In addition The Taylor Review outlines demands asking the distribution of power be distributed at a more equal level. It asks for workers of these gig economy businesses be labeled as dependent contractors with extra benefits . Other demands include better corporate management skill development efforts fostering of a positive workplace and financial representation provided by the state.

"29",29,"zero waste","/wiki/Zero_waste",TRUE,0,"waste|product|","Zero Waste is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused","Zero Waste is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused. The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills incinerators or the ocean. Currently only of plastic is actually recycled. The process recommended is one similar to the way that resources are reused in nature. The definition adopted by the Zero Waste International Alliance ZWIA is Zero Waste The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production consumption reuse and recovery of all products packaging and materials without burning them and without discharges to land water or air that threaten the environment or human health. Zero Waste refers to waste prevention as opposed to end of pipe waste management. It is a whole systems approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society resulting in no waste. Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through recycling and reuse it focuses on restructuring production and distribution systems to reduce waste. Zero waste is more of a goal or ideal rather than a hard target. according to whom Zero Waste provides guiding principles for continually working towards eliminating wastes. Advocates expect that government regulation is needed to influence industrial choices over product and packaging design manufacturing processes and material selection. Advocates say eliminating waste decreases pollution and can also reduce costs due to the reduced need for raw materials. Cradle to grave is a term used to describe a linear model for materials that begins with resource extraction moves to product manufacturing and ends by a grave where the product is disposed of in a landfill. Cradle to grave is in direct contrast to cradle to cradle. Cradle to cradle is a term used in life cycle analysis to describe a material or product that is recycled into a new product at the end of its life so that ultimately there is no waste. Cradle to cradle focuses on designing industrial systems so that materials flow in closed loop cycles which mean that waste is minimized and waste products can be recycled and reused. Cradle to cradle simply goes beyond dealing with issues of waste after it has been created by addressing problems at the source and by re defining problems by focusing on design. The cradle to cradle model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations. The cradle to cradle framework has evolved steadily from theory to practice. In the industrial sector it is creating a new notion of materials and material flows. Just as in the natural world in which one organism s waste cycles through an ecosystem to provide nourishment for other living things cradle to cradle materials circulate in closed loop cycles providing nutrients for nature or industry. An example of a closed loop cradle to cradle product design is DesignTex Fabric. It has designed an upholstery fabric Climatex Lifecycle which is a blend of pesticide and residue free wool and organically grown ramie dyed and processed entirely with nontoxic chemicals. The spread of industrialization worldwide has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production. In the World Bank stated that .billion tonnes of municipal waste was produced by urban populations and estimates that that number will reach . billion tonnes by Global Solid Waste Management Market Analysis and Forecast . The increase in solid waste production increases the need for landfills. With the increase in urbanization these landfills are being placed closer to communities. These landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status with primarily non white populations. Findings indicated these areas are often targeted as waste sites because permits are more easily acquired and there was generally less community resistance. Additionally within the last five years more than hazardous waste facilities have received formal enforcement actions for unspecified violations that were considered to be a risk to human health. There is a growing global population that is faced with limited resources from the environment. To relieve the pressures placed on the finite resources available it has become more important to prevent waste. To achieve zero waste waste management has to move from a linear system to be more cyclical so that materials products and substances are used as efficiently as possible. Materials must be chosen so that it may either return safely to a cycle within the environment or remain viable in the industrial cycle. Zero waste promotes not only reuse and recycling but more importantly it promotes prevention and product designs that consider the entire product life cycle. Zero waste designs strive for reduced materials use use of recycled materials use of more benign materials longer product lives reparability and ease of disassembly at end of life. Zero waste strongly supports sustainability by protecting the environment reducing costs and producing additional jobs in the management and handling of wastes back into the industrial cycle. A Zero waste strategy may be applied to businesses communities industrial sectors schools and homes. Benefits proposed by advocates include A major issue with landfills is hydrogen sulfide which is released during the natural decay of waste. Studies have shown a positive association between increased lung cancer mortality rates and increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory disease and hydrogen sulfide exposure. These studies also showed that the hydrogen sulfide exposure increased with proximity to the landfill. Household chemicals and prescription drugs are increasingly being found in large quantities in the leachate from landfills. This is causing concern about the ability of landfills to contain these materials and the possibility of these chemicals and drugs making their way into the groundwater and the surrounding environment. Zero waste promotes a circular material flow that allows materials to be used over and over reducing the need for landfill space. Through zero waste the number of toxins released into the air and water would be decreased and products examined to determine what chemicals are used in the production process. Health Issues related to landfills Zero waste s promotion of a cyclical product life can help reduce the need to create and fill landfills. This can help reduce incidences of respiratory diseases and birth defects that are associated with the toxins released from landfills. Zero waste also can help preserve local environments and drinking water sources by preventing pollutants from entering the ecosystem. The movement gained publicity and reached a peak in and since then has been moving from theory into action by focusing on how a zero waste community is structured and behaves. The website of the Zero Waste International Alliance has a listing of communities across the globe that have created public policy to promote zero waste practices. See also the Eco Cycle website for examples of how this large nonprofit is leading Boulder County Colorado on a Zero Waste path and watch a minute video about the zero waste big picture. Finally there is a USA zero waste organization named the GrassRoots Recycling Network that puts on workshops and conferences about zero waste activities. The California Integrated Waste Management Board established a zero waste goal in . The City and County of San Francisco s Department of the Environment established a goal of zero waste in which led to the City s Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in . With its ambitious goal of zero waste and policies San Francisco reached a record breaking diversion rate in the highest diversion rate in any North American city. San Francisco received a perfect score in the waste category in the Siemens US and Canada Green City Index which named San Francisco the greenest city in North America. There is a lack of consensus among environmentalists as to whether the Zero Waste movement is in conflict with or supportive of sustainable life cycle of resource consumption. Critics of Zero Waste point out that a material could be reuseable organic non toxic and renewable but still be ethically inferior to single use products. Bags made of baby seal pelts or tiger skin for example theoretically meet the definitions of zero waste but are hardly superior to single use plastic bags. Similarly a toxic material such as lead in solder may be replaced by less toxic materials like tin and silver. But if the mining of silver and tin releases more mercury or damages sensitive coral islands the protection of landfills in developed nations is hardly paramount. While Zero Waste advocates have sophisticated answers as to why these examples do not meet the definition of Zero Waste e.g. that the bodies of seals and tigers or mining waste is of equal concern critics say that Life Cycle Analysis habitat protection carbon neutralization or Zero Extinction are more environmentally astute philosophies than waste centric measures. The simple accounting of measurable waste diversion reuse recycling rates etc. is an attractive and useful tool but a campaign based on a goal of literally stopping the last percent of waste might well come at the expense of other environmental and sustainability goals. Within the waste industry itself other tensions exist between those who view zero waste as post discard total recycling of materials only and those who view zero waste as the reuse of all high level function. It is probably the defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero wasters. A signature example is a difference between smashing a glass bottle recovering cheap glass and refilling the bottle recovering the entire function of the container . The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non natural such as chemicals and plastics that are mono molecular and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context. Biodegradable plastic is the most prominent example. One side argues that biodegradation of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built raw materials are procured investments are made machinery is built and used humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education housing food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest. Companies moving towards zero landfill plants include Subaru Xerox and Anheuser Busch. The movement continues to grow among the youth around the world under the organization Zero Waste Youth which originated in Brazil and has spread to Argentina Puerto Rico Mexico the United States and Russia. The organization multiplies with local volunteer ambassadors who lead zero waste gatherings and events to spread the zero waste message. Milk can be shipped in many forms. One of the traditional forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues other options have recently been more common one way gable top paperboard cartons one way aseptic cartons one way recyclable glass bottles one way milk bags and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint the reuse of bottles is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input or resource is silica sand which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with milk and distributed to the consumer. A reverse logistics system returns the bottles for cleaning inspection sanitization and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized. The material waste is primarily the wash water detergent transportation heat bottle caps etc. While true zero waste is never achieved a life cycle assessment can be used to calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle. It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste. Some who claim that the key component to zero waste is recycling while others who reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states that the US recycles at a national rate of . and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated for example by the inclusion of soil and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily in the recycled column. In states with recycling incentives there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures. The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the computer industry where worldwide millions of PC s are disposed of as electronic waste each year million in . Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of raw materials while most merely enter dumps through export to third world countries. Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials notably steel copper and glass reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand there is an industry more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse that actually repairs computers. It is called the Computer Refurbishing industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools clinics and non profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair. There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example quoted in Getting To Zero Waste is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software called objects in software design as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved such as paper or diskettes is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application. The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as greenwashing i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste on the other hand offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example in Alameda County California garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of ton as of which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling. Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the waste hierarchy of refuse reduce reuse recycle and rot compost . In practice these laws invariably emphasize destruction and recycling while the reuse component is marginalized. opinion A special feature of Zero Waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as nuclear waste . All processes can be designed to minimize the need for discard both in their own operations and in the usage or consumption patterns which the design of their products leads to. Recycling on the other hand deals only with simple materials. Zero Waste can even be applied to the waste of human potential by enforced poverty and the denial of educational opportunity. It encompasses redesign for reduced energy wasting in industry or transportation and the wasting of the earth s rainforests. It is a general principle of designing for the efficient use of all resources however defined. The recycling movement may be slowly branching out from its solid waste management base to include issues that are similar to the community sustainability movement. Zero waste on the other hand is not based in waste management limitations to begin with but requires that we maximize our existing reuse efforts while creating and applying new methods that minimize and eliminate destructive methods like incineration and recycling. Zero Waste strives to ensure that products are designed to be repaired refurbished re manufactured and generally reused.. What is Zero Waste para . Online web services like Free Cycle or the reGives Network have risen in popularity over the last decade where locals can give items that they no longer need to others locally in an effort to keep items out of landfills and work toward a zero waste lifestyle. Many dumps are currently exceeding carrying capacity. This is often used as a justification for moving to Zero Waste. Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the US and other countries which could be used for dumps. Proposals abound to destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan called Anything Into Oil was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in and claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into light Texas crude by the application of high pressure steam. An example of a company that has demonstrated a change in landfill waste policy is General Motors GM . GM has confirmed their plans to make approximately half of its plants worldwide landfill free by the end of . Companies like Subaru Toyota and Xerox are also producing landfill free plants. Furthermore The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize the waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is finding ways to recycle or reuse more than of materials by selling scrap materials adopting reusable parts boxes to replace cardboard and even recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature friendly it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing a more efficient production. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and producing zero waste. A garden centre in Faversham UK has started to prevent plastic plant pots from being passed down to customers. Instead it reuses the plastic pots only locally in the garden center but upon selling it to its customers it repots the plants in paper plant pots. It also sells plants wrapped in hessian and uses a variety of techniques to prevent handing down single use plastics to customers The waste sent to landfills may be harvested as useful materials such as in the production of solar energy or natural fertilizer de composted manure for crops. It may also be reused and recycled for something that we can actually use. The success of General Motors in creating zero landfill facilities shows that zero waste goals can be a powerful impetus for manufacturers to reduce their waste and carbon footprint says Latisha Petteway a spokesperson for the EPA. Zero Waste is a goal a process a way of thinking that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Zero Waste is not about recycling and diversion from landfills but about restructuring production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. The materials that are still required in these re designed resource efficient systems will be reused many times as the products that incorporate them are reused. Deconstruction can be described as construction in reverse. It involves carefully taking apart a building to maximize the reuse of materials thereby reducing waste and conserving resources. Deconstruction can capture materials and some components from the millions of buildings that are existing and that were poorly designed for high level reuse but it is not a favored approach from a Zero Waste point of view. Zero Waste favors the design of buildings as assemblages of high level components not their creation from rough materials such as lumber cement or plaster. The details are not worked out yet but to the extent that entire rooms entire walls roofs or floors or entire utility systems can be pre built and installed as completed components that will be the goal of Zero Waste design. Until buildings are built as components capable of later dismantling deconstruction is a stop gap process that the United States can use to minimize the waste of building materials. For now the largest parts that we are able to save tend to be architectural elements windows doors and metals many of which are being saved and resold by reuse yards such as Urban Ore in Berkeley California. The main parts that still need to be crushed are wood flooring brick walls and structural timbers. The demolition of traditional buildings has been long done by wrecking ball or bulldozer. Social and political artifacts such as demolition contractor licenses and required permits that can only be satisfied by destruction and discard with partial recycling of rubble and steel render the destruction and disposal costs cheaper than deconstruction. Approximately seventy pounds of the waste is generated for about every square foot of the residential building demolition. It is arguable that this is artificial economics based on the cultural preference for wastefulness and that Zero Waste designs of dismantlable components will ultimately be the cheapest as well as the most conservative way to reuse buildings. Further discussions of this topic may be found on the ZWI website. Roper s comments in the paragraph above are either misquoted or wrong concerning wood flooring structural wood and bricks needing to be crushed. Brick wood and stone are among the oldest truly recyclable materials used in construction. A historic review of old buildings barns and bridges clearly shows that brick stones and timber are reused from older buildings. Some of the oldest structures on the planet are built with materials that were recycled from previous structures. One recent example is the Mayflower Barn at Jordans just north of High Wycombe UK. The barn is clearly built of reused timbers possibly sourced from the salvage of the Mayflower ship. It is simply a fact of life that historically materials that could be reused were reused. In more recent construction structural timber components including large timbers glued laminated beams floor joists studs and flooring are some of the most valuable structural components salvaged when a structure is demolished if there is an interest in salvaging. If you need proof go down to any local construction salvage yard and look at the value of trusses wood beams floor joists studs and flooring. Today they have value when someone saves them. One of the barriers of reusing structural materials is the bias of building code officials and building departments that discriminate against reusing materials. Codes and building departments require compliance to codes including the source of materials. Your average contractor cannot just use year old x x salvaged floor joists because the building department requires a graded joist. The contractor then has to find an engineer or wood technologist to verify the material suitability for its use. While the codes technically allow this under alternative method modern attention to cost usually prevents that option. Market based legislation mediated campaigns like Extended Producer Responsibility EPR and the Precautionary Principle are among numerous campaigns that have a Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they will ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment there is no evidence that EPR will increase reuse rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put forward to shift liability for proving new chemicals are safe from the public acting as guinea pig to the company introducing them. As such its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise many organizations cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples Home Depot Toyota General Motors and computer take back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald s to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign. National and provincial governments often set targets and may provide some funding but on a practical level waste management programs e.g. pickup dropoff or containers for recycling and composting are usually implemented by local governments possibly with regionally shared facilities. Reaching the goal of zero waste requires the products of manufacturers and industrial designers to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system durability and repairability also reduce unnecessary churn in the product lifecycle. Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain. If not mandated by government choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero waste friendly products can influence production. More and more schools are motivating their students to live a different live and rethink every polluting step they may take. To prevent material from becoming waste consumers businesses and non profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully. In the recent years the zero waste movement has experienced a significant increase in followers thanks to eco activists such as Bea Johnson author of Zero Waste Home and Lauren Singer an eco activist living in New York and running Social Media channels to spread the awareness about the movement. The Zero Waste Hierarchy describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the Zero Waste system from highest and best to lowest use of materials. It is designed to be applicable to all audiences from policy makers to industry and the individual. It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized Rs Reduce Reuse Recycle to encourage policy activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to Zero Waste. It enhances the Zero Waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions. All over the world in some form or another a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations solid waste management plans and resource conservation programs. In Canada a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted. This Hierarchy has been incorporated into all recycling regulations within Canada and is embedded within all resource conservation methods which all government mandated waste prevention programs follow. While the intention to incorporate the th R recovery prior to disposal was good many organizations focused on this th R instead of the top of the hierarchy resulting in costly systems designed to destroy materials instead of systems designed to reduce environmental impact and waste. Because of this along with other resource destruction systems that have been emerging over the past few decades Zero Waste Canada along with the Zero Waste International Alliance have adopted the only internationally peer reviewed Zero Waste Hierarchy that focuses on the first Rs Reduce Reuse and Recycle including Compost. Various governments have declared zero waste as a goal including An example of network governance approach can be seen in the UK under New Labour who proposed the establishment of regional groupings that brought together the key stakeholders in waste management local authority representatives waste industry government offices etc. on a voluntary basis. There is a lack of clear government policy on how to meet the targets for diversion from landfill which increases the scope at the regional and local level for governance networks. The overall goal is set by government but the route for how to achieve it is left open so stakeholders can coordinate and decide how best to reach it. Zero Waste is a strategy promoted by environmental NGOs but the waste industry is more in favour of the capital intensive option of energy from waste incineration. Research often highlights public support as the first requirement for success. In Taiwan public opinion was essential in changing the attitude of business who must transform their material use pattern to become more sustainable for Zero Waste to work. The latest development in Zero Waste is the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi which promises to be a Zero Waste city. Innovation and technology is encouraged by government creating an innovation friendly environment without being prescriptive. To be a successful model of sustainable urban development it will also require the involvement and co operation from all members of society emphasizing the importance of network governance.",FALSE
"30",30,"digestate","/wiki/Digestate",TRUE,0,"material|material|","Digestate is the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion of a biodegradable feedstock","Digestate is the material remaining after the anaerobic digestion of a biodegradable feedstock. Anaerobic digestion produces two main products digestate and biogas. Digestate is produced both by acidogenesis and methanogenesis and each has different characteristics. Acidogenic digestate is fibrous and consists of structural plant matter including lignin and cellulose. Acidogenic digestate has high moisture retention properties. The digestate may also contain minerals and remnants of bacteria. Methanogenic digestate is a sludge sometimes called a liquor . This is often high in nutrients such as ammoniums and phosphates. The primary use of digestate is as a soil conditioner. Acidogenic digestate provides moisture retention and organic content for soils. This organic material can break down further aerobically in soil. Methanogenic digestate provides nutrients for plant growth. It can also be used to protect soils against erosion. Acidogenic digestate can also be used as an environmentally friendly filler to give structure to composite plastics. Growth trials on digestate originating from mixed waste have showed healthy growth results for crops. Digestate can also be used in intensive greenhouse cultivation of plants e.g. in Digeponics. Application of digestate has been shown to inhibit plant diseases and induction of resistance. Digestate application has a direct effect on soil born diseases and an indirect effect by stimulation of biological activity. Digestate is technically not compost although it is similar to it in physical and chemical characteristics. Compost is produced by aerobic digestion decomposition by aerobes. This includes fungi and bacteria which are able to break down the lignin and cellulose to a greater extent. Treatment e.g. by ultrasonication has shown to enhance solubilization of digestate as measued by increased levels of soluble Chemical Oxygen Demand sCOD soluble Total Organic Carbon sTOC and soluble Total Nitrogen sTN released into the solution . The standard of digestate produced by anaerobic digestion can be assessed on three criteria chemical biological and physical aspects. Chemical quality needs to be considered in terms of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminant persistent organic compounds and the content of macro elements such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium. Depending on their source biowastes can contain pathogens which can lead to the spreading of human animal or plant diseases if not appropriately managed. The physical standards of composts includes mainly appearance and odour factors. Whilst physical contamination does not present a problem with regards to human plant or animal health contamination in the form of plastics metals and ceramics can cause a negative public perception. Even if the compost is of high quality and all standards are met a negative public perception of waste based composts still exists. The presence of visible contaminants reminds users of this. Quality control of the feedstock is the most important way of ensuring a quality end product. The content and quality of waste arriving on site should be characterised as thoroughly as possible prior to being supplied. In the UK the Publicly Available Specification called PAS governs the definition of digestate derived from the anaerobic digestion of source segregated biodegradable materials. The specification ensures all digested materials are of consistent quality and fit for purpose. If a biogas plant meets the standard its digestate will be regarded as having been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste and it can be sold with the name Bio fertiliser .",FALSE
"31",31,"green economy","/wiki/Green_economy",TRUE,0,"sustainable|","The green economy is defined as economy that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment","The green economy is defined as economy that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with ecological economics but has a more politically applied focus. The UNEP Green Economy Report argues that to be green an economy must not only be efficient but also fair. Fairness implies recognizing global and country level equity dimensions particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low carbon resource efficient and socially inclusive. A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of natural capital and ecological services as having economic value see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity and Bank of Natural Capital and a full cost accounting regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to and accounted for as liabilities of the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset. Green Sticker and ecolabel practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a globalizing economy. Green economics is loosely defined as any theory of economics by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides after Lynn Margulis . A holistic approach to the subject is typical such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects depending on the particular theorist. Proponents of feminism postmodernism the environmental movement peace movement Green politics green anarchism and anti globalization movement have used the term to describe very different ideas all external to mainstream economics. citation needed The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of Green parties which are formally organized and claim the capital G Green term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of green economists who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy biomimicry and a fuller accounting for biodiversity. see The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and Bank of Natural Capital for a layperson s presentation of these. citation needed Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools. For instance it is regarded as classical economics where the traditional land is generalized to natural capital and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man made ones such as canals . Or it is viewed as Marxist economics with nature represented as a form of Lumpenproletariat an exploited base of non human workers providing surplus value to the human economy or as a branch of neoclassical economics in which the price of life for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non human life is very low. citation needed An increasing commitment by the UNEP and national governments such as the UK to the ideas of natural capital and full cost accounting under the banner green economy could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of green economics . As of the Bretton Woods institutions notably the World Bank and International Monetary Fund via its Green Fund initiative responsible for global monetary policy have stated a clear intention to move towards biodiversity valuation and a more official and universal biodiversity finance. citation needed Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives. citation needed The UNEP Green Economy Report informs that based on existing studies the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US . to US . trillion. To place this demand in perspective it is about one tenth of total global investment per year as measured by global Gross Capital Formation. Karl Burkart defines a green economy as based on six main sectors The International Chamber of Commerce ICC representing global business defines green economy as an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development . In the ICC published the Green Economy Roadmap containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two year consultation process. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of green economy . It highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges. It sets out the following conditions which relate to business intra industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of economic index indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact efficiency sectors like transport energy buildings and tourism as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation. Ecological footprint measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments. Green economies require green energy generation based on renewable energy to replace fossil fuels as well as energy conservation and efficient energy use. citation needed There is justification for market failure to respond to environmental protection and climate protection needs with the excuse that high external costs and high initial costs for research development and marketing of green energy sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints. The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The German Renewable Energy Act legislations of many other member states of the European Union and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of all provide such market incentives. citation needed However other experts argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer. A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the Green Economy particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using price mechanisms to protect nature arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio economy will spur even greater convergence of corporate power and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than years. Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP s report Towards a Green Economy while well intentioned ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets even when a large majority of the population call for them is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations. Ulrich Hoffmann in a paper for UNCTAD also says that the focus on Green Economy and green growth in particular based on an evolutionary and often reductionist approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate change and may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can bring about a U turn of global greenhouse gas emissions. Clive Spash an ecological economist has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses and argued that the Green Economy as advocated by the UN is not a new approach at all and is actually a diversion from the real drivers of environmental crisis. He has also criticised the UN s project on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity TEEB and the basis for valuing ecosystems services in monetary terms.",FALSE

As the term sustainability would imply those who study SC seek to apply the concept of continuance the capacity to meet both present and future human generational needs. SC then would also include analyses of efficiency infrastructure and waste as well as access to basic services green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. It shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms sustainable production and sustainable development. Sustainable consumption as part of sustainable development is a prerequisite in the worldwide struggle against sustainability challenges such as climate change resource depletion famines or environmental pollution. Sustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as The definition proposed by the Oslo Symposium on Sustainable Consumption defines it as the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations. In order to achieve sustainable consumption two developments have to take place it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries as well as rich social classes in developing countries which have also a large ecological footprint and give examples for increasing middle classes in developing countries . The first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption. Here technological improvements and eco efficiency support a necessary reduction in resource consumption. Once this aim has been met the second prerequisite the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable. Strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of well being and assess the need for changes based on a risk averse perspective. In order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required. In the political arena weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates. The so called attitude behaviour or values action gap describes a significant obstacle to changes in individual customer behavior. Many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues however most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase decision making process is highly complicated and relies on e.g. social political and psychological factors. Young et al. identified a lack of time for research high prices a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to green consumption choices.",FALSE
"33",33,"eco-design","/wiki/Ecodesign",TRUE,0,"approach|product|","Ecodesign is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle","Ecodesign is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle. In a life cycle assessment the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement manufacture use and disposal. Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our ecological footprint on the planet. Green awareness overpopulation industrialization and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are environmentally friendly and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and energy. As the whole product s life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective representatives from advance development design production marketing purchasing and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product. Together they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact. An eco design product has a cradle to cradle life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature eco design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly circular economy. Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are Waste hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment e.g. methane and leaching from landfills are inventoried. All consumables materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production. The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters such as extent of environmental impact potential for improvement or potential of change. According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time. One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis EEA . For an EEA the following are taken into account Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design the impact of global warming and an increase in CO emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process. In building design and construction designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste. With respect to these concepts online platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer. EcoMaterials such as the use of local raw materials are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping fuel consumption and CO emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations with accreditations from companies such as the Forest Stewardship Council FSC or the Pan European Forest Certification Council PEFCC can be used. Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction but it is important that they don t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved. Water recycling systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing grey water generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water. Off grid homes only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems. These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy for example solar wind thermal biomass and geothermal energy. Solar power is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel and reduce CO emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. This is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels. Biomass is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process. Geothermal energy is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design. Wind turbines are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources e.g. rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property. Buildings that integrate passive energy systems bioclimatic buildings are heated using non mechanical methods thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun s rays thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room. A green roof is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building s temperature. It also retains water providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing. Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the th century when cubist artist Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque created collages from newsprints packaging and other found materials. The Outside Art movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them. The same principle can be used inside the home where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon. There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a green style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials. ",FALSE

"35",35,"environmental resource management","/wiki/Environmental_resource_management",TRUE,0,"action|","Environmental resource management is the management of the interaction and impact of human societies on the environment"," Environmental resource management is the management of the interaction and impact of human societies on the environment. It is not as the phrase might suggest the management of the environment itself. Environmental resources management aims to ensure that ecosystem services are protected and maintained for future human generations and also maintain ecosystem integrity through considering ethical economic and scientific ecological variables. Environmental resource management tries to identify factors affected by conflicts that rise between meeting needs and protecting resources. It is thus linked to environmental protection sustainability and integrated landscape management. Environmental resource management is an issue of increasing concern as reflected in its prevalence in several texts influencing global sociopolitical frameworks such as the Brundtland Commission s Our Common Future which highlighted the integrated nature of environment and international development and the Worldwatch Institute s annual State of the World reports. The environment determines the nature of people animals plants and places around the Earth affecting behaviour religion culture and economic practices. Environmental resource management can be viewed from a variety of perspectives. It involves the management of all components of the biophysical environment both living biotic and non living abiotic and the relationships among all living species and their habitats. The environment also involves the relationships of the human environment such as the social cultural and economic environment with the biophysical environment. The essential aspects of environmental resource management are ethical economical social and technological. These underlie principles and help make decisions. The concept of environmental determinism probabilism and possibilism are significant in the concept of environmental resource management. Environmental resource management covers many areas in science including geography biology social sciences political sciences public policy ecology physics chemistry sociology psychology and physiology. Environmental resource management strategies are intrinsically driven by conceptions of human nature relationships. Ethical aspects involve the cultural and social issues relating to the environment and dealing with changes to it. All human activities take place in the context of certain types of relationships between society and the bio physical world the rest of nature and so there is a great significance in understanding the ethical values of different groups around the world. Broadly speaking two schools of thought exist in environmental ethics Anthropocentrism and Ecocentrism each influencing a broad spectrum of environmental resource management styles along a continuum. These styles perceive ...different evidence imperatives and problems and prescribe different solutions strategies technologies roles for economic sectors culture governments and ethics etc. Anthropocentrism ...an inclination to evaluate reality exclusively in terms of human values is an ethic reflected in the major interpretations of Western religions and the dominant economic paradigms of the industrialised world. Anthropocentrism looks at nature as existing solely for the benefit of humans and as a commodity to use for the good of humanity and to improve human quality of life. Anthropocentric environmental resource management is therefore not the conservation of the environment solely for the environment s sake but rather the conservation of the environment and ecosystem structure for humans sake. Ecocentrists believe in the intrinsic value of nature while maintaining that human beings must use and even exploit nature to survive and live. It is this fine ethical line that ecocentrists navigate between fair use and abuse. At an extreme of the ethical scale ecocentrism includes philosophies such as ecofeminism and deep ecology which evolved as a reaction to dominant anthropocentric paradigms. In its current form it is an attempt to synthesize many old and some new philosophical attitudes about the relationship between nature and human activity with particular emphasis on ethical social and spiritual aspects that have been downplayed in the dominant economic worldview. The economy functions within and is dependent upon goods and services provided by natural ecosystems. The role of the environment is recognized in both classical economics and neoclassical economics theories yet the environment was a lower priority in economic policies from to due to emphasis from policy makers on economic growth. With the prevalence of environmental problems many economists embraced the notion that If environmental sustainability must coexist for economic sustainability then the overall system must permit identification of an equilibrium between the environment and the economy. As such economic policy makers began to incorporate the functions of the natural environment or natural capital particularly as a sink for wastes and for the provision of raw materials and amenities. Debate continues among economists as to how to account for natural capital specifically whether resources can be replaced through knowledge and technology or whether the environment is a closed system that cannot be replenished and is finite. Economic models influence environmental resource management in that management policies reflect beliefs about natural capital scarcity. For someone who believes natural capital is infinite and easily substituted environmental management is irrelevant to the economy. For example economic paradigms based on neoclassical models of closed economic systems are primarily concerned with resource scarcity and thus prescribe legalizing the environment as an economic externality for an environmental resource management strategy. This approach has often been termed Command and control . Colby has identified trends in the development of economic paradigms among them a shift towards more ecological economics since the s. The pairing of significant uncertainty about the behaviour and response of ecological systems with urgent calls for near term action constitutes a difficult reality and a common lament for many environmental resource managers. Scientific analysis of the environment deals with several dimensions of ecological uncertainty. These include structural uncertainty resulting from the misidentification or lack of information pertaining to the relationships between ecological variables parameter uncertainty referring to uncertainty associated with parameter values that are not known precisely but can be assessed and reported in terms of the likelihood of experiencing a defined range of outcomes and stochastic uncertainty stemming from chance or unrelated factors. Adaptive management is considered a useful framework for dealing with situations of high levels of uncertainty though it is not without its detractors. A common scientific concept and impetus behind environmental resource management is carrying capacity. Simply put carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of organisms a particular resource can sustain. The concept of carrying capacity whilst understood by many cultures over history has its roots in Malthusian theory. An example is visible in the EU Water Framework Directive. However it is argued that Western scientific knowledge ... is often insufficient to deal with the full complexity of the interplay of variables in environmental resource management. These concerns have been recently addressed by a shift in environmental resource management approaches to incorporate different knowledge systems including traditional knowledge reflected in approaches such as adaptive co management community based natural resource management and transitions management. among others. Sustainability in environmental resource management involves managing economic social and ecological systems both within and outside an organizational entity so it can sustain itself and the system it exists in. In context sustainability implies that rather than competing for endless growth on a finite planet development improves quality of life without necessarily consuming more resources. Sustainably managing environmental resources requires organizational change that instills sustainability values that portrays these values outwardly from all levels and reinforces them to surrounding stakeholders. The end result should be a symbiotic relationship between the sustaining organization community and environment. Many drivers compel environmental resource management to take sustainability issues into account. Today s economic paradigms do not protect the natural environment yet they deepen human dependency on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ecologically massive environmental degradation and climate change threaten the stability of ecological systems that humanity depends on. Socially an increasing gap between rich and poor and the global North South divide denies many access to basic human needs rights and education leading to further environmental destruction. The planet s unstable condition is caused by many anthropogenic sources. As an exceptionally powerful contributing factor to social and environmental change the modern organisation has the potential to apply environmental resource management with sustainability principals to achieve highly effective outcomes. To achieve sustainable development with environmental resource management an organisation should work within sustainability principles including social and environmental accountability long term planning a strong shared vision a holistic focus devolved and consensus decision making broad stakeholder engagement and justice transparency measures trust and flexibility. To adjust to today s environment of quick social and ecological changes some organizations have begun to experiment with new tools and concepts. Those that are more traditional and stick to hierarchical decision making have difficulty dealing with the demand for lateral decision making that supports effective participation. Whether it be a matter of ethics or just strategic advantage organizations are internalizing sustainability principles. Some of the world s largest and most profitable corporations are shifting to sustainable environmental resource management Ford Toyota BMW Honda Shell Du Port Sta toil Swiss Re Hewlett Packard and Unilever among others. An extensive study by the Boston Consulting Group reaching business leaders from diverse regions job positions expertise in sustainability industries and sizes of organizations revealed the many benefits of sustainable practice as well as its viability. It is important to note that though sustainability of environmental resource management has improved corporate sustainability for one has yet to reach the majority of global companies operating in the markets. The three major barriers to preventing organizations to shift towards sustainable practice with environmental resource management are not understanding what sustainability is having difficulty modeling an economically viable case for the switch and having a flawed execution plan or a lack thereof. Therefore the most important part of shifting an organization to adopt sustainability in environmental resource management would be to create a shared vision and understanding of what sustainability is for that particular organization and to clarify the business case. The public sector comprises the general government sector plus all public corporations including the central bank. In environmental resource management the public sector is responsible for administering natural resource management and implementing environmental protection legislation. The traditional role of the public sector in environmental resource management is to provide professional judgement through skilled technicians on behalf of the public. With the increase of intractable environmental problems the public sector has been led to examine alternative paradigms for managing environmental resources. This has resulted in the public sector working collaboratively with other sectors including other governments private and civil to encourage sustainable natural resource management behaviours. The private sector comprises private corporations and non profit institutions serving households. The private sector s traditional role in environmental resource management is that of the recovery of natural resources. Such private sector recovery groups include mining minerals and petroleum forestry and fishery organisations. Environmental resource management undertaken by the private sectors varies dependent upon the resource type that being renewable or non renewable and private and common resources also see Tragedy of the Commons . Environmental managers from the private sector also need skills to manage collaboration within a dynamic social and political environment. Civil society comprises associations in which societies voluntarily organise themselves into and which represent a wide range of interests and ties. These can include community based organisations indigenous peoples organisations and non government organisations NGO . Functioning through strong public pressure civil society can exercise their legal rights against the implementation of resource management plans particularly land management plans. The aim of civil society in environmental resource management is to be included in the decision making process by means of public participation. Public participation can be an effective strategy to invoke a sense of social responsibility of natural resources. As with all management functions effective management tools standards and systems are required. An environmental management standard or system or protocol attempts to reduce environmental impact as measured by some objective criteria. The ISO standard is the most widely used standard for environmental risk management and is closely aligned to the European Eco Management and Audit Scheme EMAS . As a common auditing standard the ISO standard explains how to combine this with quality management. Other environmental management systems EMS tend to be based on the ISO standard and many extend it in various ways Other strategies exist that rely on making simple distinctions rather than building top down management systems using performance audits and full cost accounting. For instance Ecological Intelligent Design divides products into consumables service products or durables and unsaleables toxic products that no one should buy or in many cases do not realize they are buying. By eliminating the unsaleables from the comprehensive outcome of any purchase better environmental resource management is achieved without systems. Recent successful cases have put forward the notion of integrated management. It shares a wider approach and stresses out the importance of interdisciplinary assessment. It is an interesting notion that might not be adaptable to all cases.",FALSE

Extended producer responsibility legislation is a driving force behind the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives because it focuses on the end of use treatment of consumer products and has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of waste materials . The concept was first formally introduced in Sweden by Thomas Lindhqvist in a report to the Swedish Ministry of the Environment. In subsequent reports prepared for the Ministry the following definition emerged EPR is an environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a decreased total environmental impact of a product by making the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life cycle of the product and especially for the take back recycling and final disposal. EPR uses financial incentive s to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. This policy approach differs from product stewardship which shares responsibility across the chain of custody of a product in that it attempts to relieve local governments of the costs of managing certain priority products by requiring manufacturers to internalize the cost of recycling within the product price. EPR is based on the principle that manufacturers usually brand owners have the greatest control over product design and marketing and have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity and waste. EPR may take the form of a reuse buyback or recycling program. The producer may also choose to delegate this responsibility to a third party a so called producer responsibility organization PRO which is paid by the producer for used product management. In this way EPR shifts the responsibility for waste management from government to private industry obliging producers importers and or sellers to internalise waste management costs in their product prices and ensure the safe handling of their products. A good example of a producer responsibility organization is PRO Europe S.P.R.L. Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe founded in the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO Europe are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis on behalf of their member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner. In many countries this is done through the Green Dot trademark of which PRO Europe is the general licensor. In twenty five nations companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery sorting and recycling of sales packaging. In response to the growing problem of excessive waste several countries adopted waste management policies in which manufacturers are responsible for taking back their products from end users at the end of the products useful life or partially financing a collection and recycling infrastructure. These policies were adopted due to the lack of collection infrastructure for certain products that contain hazardous materials or due to the high costs to local governments of providing such collection services. The primary goals of these take back laws therefore are to partner with the private sector to ensure that all waste is managed in a way that protects public health and the environment. The goals of take back laws are to Take back programs help promote these goals by creating incentives for companies to design products that minimize waste management costs to design products that contain safer materials so they do not need to be managed separately or to design products that are easier to recycle and reuse so recycling becomes more profitable . The earliest take back activity began in Europe where government sponsored take back initiatives arose from concerns about scarce landfill space and potentially hazardous substances in component parts. The European Union adopted a directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE . The purpose of this directive is to prevent the production of waste electronics and also to encourage reuse and recycling of such waste. The directive requires the Member States to encourage design and production methods that take into account the future dismantling and recovery of their products. These take back programs have been adopted in nearly every OECD country. In the United States most of these policies have been implemented at the state level. Recycling banning and taxation fails to adequately reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags. An alternative to these policies would be to increase extended producer responsibility. In the US under the Clinton presidency the President s Council on Sustainable Development suggested EPR in order to target different participants in the cycle of a product s life. This can however make the product more expensive since the cost must be taken into consideration before being put on the market which is why it is not widely used in the United States currently. Instead there is banning or taxation of plastic bags which puts the responsibility on the consumers. In the United States EPR has not successfully been made mandatory instead being voluntary. What has been recommended is a comprehensive program which combines taxation producer responsibility and recycling to combat pollution. Many governments and companies have adopted extended producer responsibility to help address the growing problem of e waste used electronics contain materials that cannot be safely thrown away with regular household trash. In according to the Environmental Protection Agency people threw away . million tons of cell phones TVs computers and printers. Many governments have partnered with corporations in creating the necessary collection and recycling infrastructure. Some argue that local and manufacturer supported extended producer responsibility laws give manufacturers greater responsibility for the reuse recycling and disposal of their own products. The kinds of chemicals found in e waste that are particularly dangerous to human health and the environment are lead mercury brominated flame retardants and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys nerves blood bones reproductive organs and muscles. Mercury is found in flat screen TVs laptop screens and fluorescent bulbs and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system. Brominated flame retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer disruption of liver function and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer. Poorer countries are dumping grounds for e waste as many governments accept money for disposing this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries especially ones who work or live close to these dumps. In the United States states have implemented laws that require the recycling of electronic waste. Of those have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws. According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute some states have not enacted EPR laws because of a lack of recycling infrastructure and funds for proper e waste disposal. In contrast according to a study of EPR legislation done by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition states that have seen success in their e waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet. Advocates for EPR also argue that including high expectations for performance into the laws and ensuring that those are only minimum requirements contribute to making the laws successful. The larger the scope of products that can be collected the more e waste will be disposed of properly. Similar laws have been passed in other parts of the world as well. The European Union has taken steps to address some electronic waste management issues. They have restricted the use of harmful substances in member countries and have made it illegal to export waste. The Chinese laws regarding e waste are similar to the ones in the EU but they focus on banning the import of e waste. This has proven to be difficult however because illegal smuggling of waste still occurs in the country. In order to dispose of e waste in China today a license is required and plants are held responsible for treating pollution. When producers face either the financial or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use they may be incentivized to design more sustainable less toxic and more easily recyclable electronics. Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers end of life costs. Thus extended producer responsibility is often cited as one way to fight planned obsolescence because it financially encourages manufacturers to design for recycling and make products last longer. Some people have concerns about extended producer responsibility programs for complex electronics that can be difficult to safely recycle such as lithium ion polymer batteries. Others worry that such laws could increase the cost of electronics because producers would add recycling costs into the initial price tag. When companies are required to transport their products to a recycling facility it can be expensive if the product contains hazardous materials and does not have a scrap value such as with CRT televisions which can contain up to five pounds of lead. Organizations and researchers against EPR claim that the mandate would slow innovation and impede technological progress. Other critics are concerned that manufacturers may use takeback programs to take secondhand electronics off the reuse market by shredding rather than reusing or repairing goods that come in for recycling. Another argument against EPR is that EPR policies are not accelerating environmentally friendly designs because manufacturers are already starting to moving toward reduced material use per unit of output reduced energy use in making and delivering each product and improved environmental performance. The Reason Foundation argues that EPR is not clear in the way fees are established for the particular recycling processes. Fees are set in place to help incentivize recycling but this may deter the use of manufacturing with better materials for the different electronic products. There are not set fees for certain materials so confusion occurs when companies do not know what design features to include in their devices. EPR has been implemented in many forms which may be classified into three major approaches It is perhaps because of the tendency of economic policy in market driven economies not to interfere with consumers preferences that the producer centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production in statistics on energy emissions water etc. impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries on site or direct allocation rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers. On a smaller scale most existing schemes for corporate sustainability reporting include only impacts that arise out of operations controlled by the reporting company and not supply chain impacts According to this world view upstream and downstream environmental impacts are ... allocated to their immediate producers. The institutional setting and the different actors spheres of influence are not reflected . On the other hand a number of studies have highlighted that final consumption and affluence especially in the industrialised world are the main drivers for the level and growth of environmental pressure. Even though these studies provide a clear incentive for complementing producer focused environmental policy with some consideration for consumption related aspects demand side measures to environmental problems are rarely exploited. The nexus created by the different views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population irrespective of productive origin. However especially for open economies taking into account the greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse gas balance sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility exports have to be subtracted from and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark for example Munksgaard and Pedersen report that a significant amount of power and other energy intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders and that between and the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO developed from a Mt deficit to a Mt surplus compared to total emissions of approximately Mt. In particular electricity traded between Norway Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro electricity whereas electricity from coal fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle. Similarly at the company level when adopting the concept of eco efficiency and the scope of an environmental management system stated in for example ISO it is insufficient to merely report on the carbon dioxide emissions limited to the judicial borders of the company . Companies must recognise their wider responsibility and manage the entire life cycle of their products ... Insisting on high environmental standards from suppliers and ensuring that raw materials are extracted or produced in an environmentally conscious way provides a start. A life cycle perspective is also taken in EPR frameworks Producers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility physical and or financial not only for the environmental impacts of their products downstream from the treatment and disposal of their product but also for their upstream activities inherent in the selection of materials and in the design of products. The major impetus for EPR came from northern European countries in the late s and early s as they were facing severe landfill shortages. ... As a result EPR is generally applied to post consumer wastes which place increasing physical and financial demands on municipal waste management. EPR has rarely been consistently quantified. Moreover applying conventional life cycle assessment and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to double counting. Using input output analysis researchers have attempted for decades to account for both producers and consumers in an economy in a consistent way. Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers supply chains into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy. Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter connected circular system. Upstream and downstream environmental impacts are shared between all agents of a supply chain producers and consumers. Auto Recycling Nederland ARN is a producer responsibility organisation PRO that organises vehicle recycling in the Netherlands. An advanced recycling fee is charged to those who purchase a new vehicle and is used to fund the recycling of it at the end of its useful life. The PRO was set up to satisfy the European Union s End of Life Vehicles Directive. The Swiss Association for Information Communication and Organisational Technology SWICO an ICT industry organisation became a PRO to address the problem of electronic waste. The Canada Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility CAP EPR was adopted in Canada in under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The CAP EPR followed years of waste and recycling efforts in Canada that remained largely ineffective as the diversion rates from landfills and incineration persisted. Despite three decades worth of recycling efforts Canada fell short of many other G and OECD countries. Since the CAP EPR s inception most provinces have enforced legislation or restrictions on a wider range of products and materials under EPR programs. Nine out of ten provinces have since implemented EPR programs or put requirements in place As a result of these new programs or requirements and expansion of existing ones almost half of the product categories for Phase are now covered by legislated EPR programs or requirements across Canada. In Germany since the adoption of EPR between and the per capita consumption of packaging was reduced from . kg to kg resulting in a reduction of . . Furthermore due to Germany s influence in EPR the European Commission developed one waste directive for all of member states Hanisch . One major goal was to have all member states recycle of all packaging material and have accomplished the goal. In the United States EPR is gaining popularity with such laws enacted since . In alone such EPR bills were introduced in state legislatures across the United States and were signed into law. However these laws are only at the state level as there are no federal laws for EPR. So far only a handful of states have imposed five to six EPR laws as well as states having at least one EPR law .",FALSE

MFA is an important tool to study the bio physical aspects of human activity on different spatial and temporal scales. It is considered a core method of industrial ecology or anthropogenic urban social and industrial metabolism. MFA is used to study material substance or product flows across different industrial sectors or within ecosystems. MFA can also be applied to a single industrial installation for example for tracking nutrient flows through a waste water treatment plant. When combined with an assessment of the costs associated with material flows this business oriented application of MFA is called material flow cost accounting. MFA is an important tool to study the circular economy and to devise material flow management. Since the s the number of publications related to material flow analysis has grown steadily. Peer reviewed journals that publish MFA related work include the Journal of Industrial Ecology Ecological Economics Environmental Science and Technology and Resources Conservation and Recycling. Human needs such as shelter food transport or communication require materials like wood starch sugar iron and steel copper or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity expands material production use and disposal increase to a level where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be neglected anymore neither locally nor globally. Material flows are at the core of local environmental problems such as leaching from landfills or oil spills. Rising concern about global warming puts a previously unimportant waste flow carbon dioxide on top of the political and scientific agenda. The gradual shift from primary material production to urban mining in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society. Scientists industries government bodies and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering staying within and leaving the different processes in the anthroposphere. Material flow analysis is such a method. MFA is based on two fundamental and well established scientific principles the systems approach and mass balance. The system definition is the starting point of every MFA study. An MFA system is a model of an industrial plant an industrial sector or a region of concern. The level of detail of the system model is chosen to fit the purpose of the study. An MFA system always consists of the system boundary one or more processes material flows between processes and stocks of materials within processes. Physical exchange between the system and its environment happens via flows that cross the system boundary. Contrary to the preconceived notion that a system represents a specific industrial installation systems and processes in MFA can represent much larger and more abstract entities as long as they are well defined. The explicit system definition helps the practitioner to locate the available quantitative information in the system either as stocks within certain processes or as flows between processes. An MFA system description can be refined by disaggregating processes or simplified by aggregating processes. Next to specifying the arrangement of processes stocks and flows in the system definition the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied. The spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector can be applied to the USA China certain world regions or the world as a whole. The temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. The indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says an indicator element is a certain chemical element such as cadmium or a substance such as CO. In general a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars materials like steel or other physical quantities such as energy. MFA requires practitioners to make precise use of the terms material substance or good as laid out for example in chapter . of Brunner and Rechberger one of the main references for the MFA method. One of the main purposes of MFA is to quantify the metabolism of the elements of the system. Unlike economic accounting MFA also covers non economic waste flows emissions to the environment and non market natural resources. The process balance is a first order physical principle that turns MFA into a powerful accounting and analysis tool. The nature of the processes in the system determine which balances apply. For a process oil refinery for example one can establish a mass balance for each chemical element while this is not possible for a nuclear power station. A car manufacturing plant respects the balance for steel but a steel mill does not. When quantifying MFA systems either by measurements or from statistical data mass and other process balances have to be checked to ensure the correctness of the quantification and to reveal possible data inconsistencies or even misconceptions in the system such as the omission of a flow or a process. Conflicting information can be reconciled using data validation and reconciliation and the STAN software offers basic reconciliation functionality that is suitable for many MFA application. MFA studies are conducted on various spatial and temporal scales and for a variety of elements substances and goods. They cover a wide range of process chains and material cycles. Several examples A state of the art MFA consists of the following steps While the term substance in substance flow analysis SFA always refers to chemical substances the term material in material flow analysis MFA has a much wider scope. According to Brunner and Rechberger the term material comprises substances AND goods and the reason for this wide scope is the wish to apply MFA not only to chemical elements or substances but also to materials like steel timber or products like cars or buildings. It is thus possible to conduct an MFA for the passenger vehicle fleet by recording the vehicles entering and leaving the use phase. MFA is complementary to the other core industrial ecology methods life cycle assessment LCA and input output I O models. Some overlaps between the different methods exist as they all share the system approach and to some extent the mass balance principle. The methods mainly differ in purpose scope and data requirements. MFA studies often cover the entire cycle mining production manufacturing use waste handling of a certain substance within a given geographical boundary and time frame. Material stocks are explicit in MFA which makes this method suitable for studies involving resource scarcity and recycling from old scrap. The common use of time series dynamic modelling and lifetime models makes MFA a suitable tool for assessing long term trends in material use.",FALSE

System dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame understand and discuss complex issues and problems. Originally developed in the s to help corporate managers improve their understanding of industrial processes SD is currently being used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design. Convenient graphical user interface GUI system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the s and have been applied to diverse systems. SD models solve the problem of simultaneity mutual causation by updating all variables in small time increments with positive and negative feedbacks and time delays structuring the interactions and control. The best known SD model is probably the The Limits to Growth. This model forecast that exponential growth of population and capital with finite resource sources and sinks and perception delays would lead to economic collapse during the st century under a wide variety of growth scenarios. System dynamics is an aspect of systems theory as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The basis of the method is the recognition that the structure of any system the many circular interlocking sometimes time delayed relationships among its components is often just as important in determining its behavior as the individual components themselves. Examples are chaos theory and social dynamics. It is also claimed that because there are often properties of the whole which cannot be found among the properties of the elements in some cases the behavior of the whole cannot be explained in terms of the behavior of the parts. System dynamics was created during the mid s by Professor Jay Forrester of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In Forrester accepted a professorship in the newly formed MIT Sloan School of Management. His initial goal was to determine how his background in science and engineering could be brought to bear in some useful way on the core issues that determine the success or failure of corporations. Forrester s insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering which led to the creation of system dynamics were triggered to a large degree by his involvement with managers at General Electric GE during the mid s. At that time the managers at GE were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in Kentucky exhibited a significant three year cycle. The business cycle was judged to be an insufficient explanation for the employment instability. From hand simulations or calculations of the stock flow feedback structure of the GE plants which included the existing corporate decision making structure for hiring and layoffs Forrester was able to show how the instability in GE employment was due to the internal structure of the firm and not to an external force such as the business cycle. These hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics. During the late s and early s Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand simulation stage to the formal computer modeling stage. Richard Bennett created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations in the spring of . In Phyllis Fox and Alexander Pugh wrote the first version of DYNAMO DYNAmic MOdels an improved version of SIMPLE and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first and still classic book in the field titled Industrial Dynamics in . From the late s to the late s system dynamics was applied almost exclusively to corporate managerial problems. In however an unexpected occurrence caused the field to broaden beyond corporate modeling. John F. Collins the former mayor of Boston was appointed a visiting professor of Urban Affairs at MIT. The result of the Collins Forrester collaboration was a book titled Urban Dynamics. The Urban Dynamics model presented in the book was the first major non corporate application of system dynamics. The second major noncorporate application of system dynamics came shortly after the first. In Jay Forrester was invited by the Club of Rome to a meeting in Bern Switzerland. The Club of Rome is an organization devoted to solving what its members describe as the predicament of mankind that is the global crisis that may appear sometime in the future due to the demands being placed on the Earth s carrying capacity its sources of renewable and nonrenewable resources and its sinks for the disposal of pollutants by the world s exponentially growing population. At the Bern meeting Forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind. His answer of course was that it could. On the plane back from the Bern meeting Forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world s socioeconomic system. He called this model WORLD. Upon his return to the United States Forrester refined WORLD in preparation for a visit to MIT by members of the Club of Rome. Forrester called the refined version of the model WORLD. Forrester published WORLD in a book titled World Dynamics. The elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays. As an illustration of the use of system dynamics imagine an organisation that plans to introduce an innovative new durable consumer product. The organisation needs to understand the possible market dynamics in order to design marketing and production plans. In the system dynamics methodology a problem or a system e.g. ecosystem political system or mechanical system may be represented as a causal loop diagram. A causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions. By capturing interactions and consequently the feedback loops see figure below a causal loop diagram reveals the structure of a system. By understanding the structure of a system it becomes possible to ascertain a system s behavior over a certain time period. The causal loop diagram of the new product introduction may look as follows There are two feedback loops in this diagram. The positive reinforcement labeled R loop on the right indicates that the more people have already adopted the new product the stronger the word of mouth impact. There will be more references to the product more demonstrations and more reviews. This positive feedback should generate sales that continue to grow. The second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement or balancing and hence labeled B . Clearly growth cannot continue forever because as more and more people adopt there remain fewer and fewer potential adopters. Both feedback loops act simultaneously but at different times they may have different strengths. Thus one might expect growing sales in the initial years and then declining sales in the later years. However in general a causal loop diagram does not specify the structure of a system sufficiently to permit determination of its behavior from the visual representation alone. Causal loop diagrams aid in visualizing a system s structure and behavior and analyzing the system qualitatively. To perform a more detailed quantitative analysis a causal loop diagram is transformed to a stock and flow diagram. A stock and flow model helps in studying and analyzing the system in a quantitative way such models are usually built and simulated using computer software. A stock is the term for any entity that accumulates or depletes over time. A flow is the rate of change in a stock. In our example there are two stocks Potential adopters and Adopters. There is one flow New adopters. For every new adopter the stock of potential adopters declines by one and the stock of adopters increases by one. The real power of system dynamics is utilised through simulation. Although it is possible to perform the modeling in a spreadsheet there are a variety of software packages that have been optimised for this. The steps involved in a simulation are In this example the equations that change the two stocks via the flow are List of all the equations in discrete time in their order of execution in each year for years to The dynamic simulation results show that the behaviour of the system would be to have growth in adopters that follows a classic s curve shape. The increase in adopters is very slow initially then exponential growth for a period followed ultimately by saturation. To get intermediate values and better accuracy the model can run in continuous time we multiply the number of units of time and we proportionally divide values that change stock levels. In this example we multiply the years by to obtain trimesters and we divide the value of the flow by . Dividing the value is the simplest with the Euler method but other methods could be employed instead such as Runge Kutta methods. List of the equations in continuous time for trimesters to System dynamics has found application in a wide range of areas for example population agriculture ecological and economic systems which usually interact strongly with each other. System dynamics have various back of the envelope management applications. They are a potent tool to Computer software is used to simulate a system dynamics model of the situation being studied. Running what if simulations to test certain policies on such a model can greatly aid in understanding how the system changes over time. System dynamics is very similar to systems thinking and constructs the same causal loop diagrams of systems with feedback. However system dynamics typically goes further and utilises simulation to study the behaviour of systems and the impact of alternative policies. System dynamics has been used to investigate resource dependencies and resulting problems in product development. A system dynamics approach to macroeconomics known as Minsky has been developed by the economist Steve Keen. This has been used to successfully model world economic behaviour from the apparent stability of the Great Moderation to the sudden unexpected Financial crisis of . The figure above is a causal loop diagram of a system dynamics model created to examine forces that may be responsible for the growth or decline of life insurance companies in the United Kingdom. A number of this figure s features are worth mentioning. The first is that the model s negative feedback loops are identified by C s which stand for Counteracting loops. The second is that double slashes are used to indicate places where there is a significant delay between causes i.e. variables at the tails of arrows and effects i.e. variables at the heads of arrows . This is a common causal loop diagramming convention in system dynamics. Third is that thicker lines are used to identify the feedback loops and links that author wishes the audience to focus on. This is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention. Last it is clear that a decision maker would find it impossible to think through the dynamic behavior inherent in the model from inspection of the figure alone.     ",FALSE
"39",39,"wastewater","/wiki/Wastewater",TRUE,0,"waste|","Wastewater or waste water is any water that has been affected by human use","Wastewater or waste water is any water that has been affected by human use. Wastewater is used water from any combination of domestic industrial commercial or agricultural activities surface runoff or stormwater and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration . Therefore wastewater is a byproduct of domestic industrial commercial or agricultural activities. The characteristics of wastewater vary depending on the source. Types of wastewater include domestic wastewater from households municipal wastewater from communities also called sewage and industrial wastewater from industrial activities. Wastewater can contain physical chemical and biological pollutants. Households may produce wastewater from flush toilets sinks dishwashers washing machines bath tubs and showers. Households that use dry toilets produce less wastewater than those that use flush toilets. Wastewater may be conveyed in a sanitary sewer which conveys only sewage. Alternatively it can be transported in a combined sewer which includes stormwater runoff and industrial wastewater. After treatment at a wastewater treatment plant the treated wastewater also called effluent is discharged to a receiving water body. The terms wastewater reuse or water reclamation apply if the treated waste is used for another purpose. Wastewater that is discharged to the environment without suitable treatment causes water pollution. In developing countries and in rural areas with low population densities wastewater is often treated by various on site sanitation systems and not conveyed in sewers. These systems include septic tanks connected to drain fields on site sewage systems OSS vermifilter systems and many more. The overarching term sanitation includes the management of wastewater human excreta solid waste and stormwater. The term sewerage refers to the physical infrastructure required to transport and treat wastewater. Sources of wastewater include the following domestic or household activities Activities producing industrial wastewater include Other related activities or events Wastewater can be diluted or mixed with other types of water through the following mechanisms The composition of wastewater varies widely. This is a partial list of pollutants that may be contained in wastewater If the wastewater contains human feces as is the case for sewage then it may also contain pathogens of one of the four types It can also contain non pathogenic bacteria and animals such as insects arthropods and small fish. Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrients almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions such as detailed above. Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the biochemical oxygen demand BOD . Such chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the chemical oxygen demand COD . Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable pollutants. Any oxidizable material present in an aerobic natural waterway or in an industrial wastewater will be oxidized both by biochemical bacterial or chemical processes. The result is that the oxygen content of the water will be decreased. At a global level around of wastewater produced is discharged into the environment untreated causing widespread water pollution. There are numerous processes that can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the type and extent of contamination. Wastewater can be treated in wastewater treatment plants which include physical chemical and biological treatment processes. Municipal wastewater is treated in sewage treatment plants which may also be referred to as wastewater treatment plants . Agricultural wastewater may be treated in agricultural wastewater treatment processes whereas industrial wastewater is treated in industrial wastewater treatment processes. For municipal wastewater the use of septic tanks and other On Site Sewage Facilities OSSF is widespread in some rural areas for example serving up to percent of the homes in the U.S. One type of aerobic treatment system is the activated sludge process based on the maintenance and recirculation of a complex biomass composed of micro organisms able to absorb and adsorb the organic matter carried in the wastewater. Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes UASB EGSB are also widely applied in the treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge. Some wastewater may be highly treated and reused as reclaimed water. Constructed wetlands are also being used. In many cities municipal wastewater is carried together with stormwater in a combined sewer system to a sewage treatment plant. In some urban areas municipal wastewater is carried separately in sanitary sewers and runoff from streets is carried in storm drains. Access to these systems for maintenance purposes is typically through a manhole. During high precipitation periods a combined sewer system may experience a combined sewer overflow event which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose a serious threat to public health and the surrounding environment. In less developed or rural regions sewage may drain directly into major watersheds with minimal or no treatment. This usually has serious impacts on the quality of an environment and on human health. Pathogens can cause a variety of illnesses. Some chemicals pose risks even at very low concentrations and can remain a threat for long periods of time because of bioaccumulation in animal or human tissue. Wastewater from factories power plants and other industrial activities is extensively regulated in developed nations and treatment is required before discharge to surface waters. See Industrial wastewater treatment. Some facilities such as oil and gas wells may be permitted to pump their wastewater underground through injection wells. Wastewater injection has been linked to induced seismicity. Treated wastewater can be reused in industry for example in cooling towers in artificial recharge of aquifers in agriculture and in the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems for example in wetlands . In rarer cases it is also used to augment drinking water supplies. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies Ozonation ultrafiltration aerobic treatment membrane bioreactor forward osmosis reverse osmosis advanced oxidation. Some water demanding activities do not require high grade water. In this case wastewater can be reused with little or no treatment. One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where toilets can be flushed using greywater from baths and showers with little or no treatment. Irrigation with recycled wastewater can also serve to fertilize plants if it contains nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium. In developing countries agriculture is using untreated wastewater for irrigation often in an unsafe manner. There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated wastewater in agriculture. The World Health Organization developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in . As part of the Environmental Protection Act the Environmental Protection Water Policy is responsible for the water management of Queensland Australia. In Nigeria the Water Resources Act of is the law responsible for all kinds of water management. In the Philippines Republic Act otherwise known as the Philippine Clean Water Act of is the governing law on wastewater management. It states that it is the country s policy to protect preserve and revive the quality of its fresh brackish and marine waters for which wastewater management plays a particular role. The Clean Water Act is the primary federal law in the United States governing water pollution in surface waters. It is implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with states territories and tribes . Groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking Water Act Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Superfund act. ",FALSE

The term itself is a play on the popular corporate phrase Cradle to Grave implying that the CC model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations i.e. from the birth or cradle of one generation to the next versus from birth to death or grave within the same generation. CC suggests that industry must protect and enrich ecosystems and nature s biological metabolism while also maintaining a safe productive technical metabolism for the high quality use and circulation of organic and technical nutrients. It is a holistic economic industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that are not only efficient but also essentially waste free. Building off the whole systems approach of John T. Lyle s regenerative design the model in its broadest sense is not limited to industrial design and manufacturing it can be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as urban environments buildings economics and social systems. The terms Cradle to Cradle is a registered trademark of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry MBDC consultants. The Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program began as a proprietary system however in MBDC turned the certification over to an independent non profit called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. Independence openness and transparency are the Institute s first objectives for the certification protocols. The phrase cradle to cradle itself was coined by Walter R. Stahel in the s. The current model is based on a system of lifecycle development initiated by Michael Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency EPEA in the s and explored through the publication A Technical Framework for Life Cycle Assessment. In Braungart and William McDonough published a book called Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things a manifesto for cradle to cradle design that gives specific details of how to achieve the model. The model has been implemented by a number of companies organizations and governments around the world predominantly in the European Union China and the United States. Cradle to cradle has also been the subject of many documentary films including the critically acclaimed Waste Food. In the cradle to cradle model all materials used in industrial or commercial processes such as metals fibers dyes fall into one of two categories technical or biological nutrients. The two types of materials each follow their own cycle in the regenerative economy envisioned by Keunen and Huizing. Initially defined by McDonough and Braungart the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute s five certification criteria are The certification is available at several levels basic silver gold platinum with more stringent requirements at each. Prior to MBDC controlled the certification protocol. Currently many human beings come into contact or consume directly or indirectly many harmful materials and chemicals daily. In addition countless other forms of plant and animal life are also exposed. CC seeks to remove dangerous technical nutrients synthetic materials such as mutagenic materials heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals from current life cycles. If the materials we come into contact with and are exposed to on a daily basis are not toxic and do not have long term health effects then the health of the overall system can be better maintained. For example a fabric factory can eliminate all harmful technical nutrients by carefully reconsidering what chemicals they use in their dyes to achieve the colours they need and attempt to do so with fewer base chemicals. The CC model shows high potential for reducing the financial cost of industrial systems. For example in the redesign of the Ford River Rouge Complex the planting of Sedum stonecrop vegetation on assembly plant roofs retains and cleanses rain water. It also moderates the internal temperature of the building in order to save energy. The roof is part of an million rainwater treatment system designed to clean billion US gallons m of rainwater annually. This saved Ford million that would otherwise have been spent on mechanical treatment facilities. Following CC design principles product manufacture can be designed to cost less for the producer and consumer. Theoretically they can eliminate the need for waste disposal such as landfills. citation needed The question of how to deal with the countless existing technical nutrients synthetic materials that cannot be recycled or reintroduced to the natural environment is dealt with in CC design. The materials that can be reused and retain their quality can be used within the technical nutrient cycles while other materials are far more difficult to deal with such as plastics in the Pacific Ocean. One potential example is a shoe that is designed and mass produced using the CC model. The sole might be made of biological nutrients while the upper parts might be made of technical nutrients . The shoe is mass produced at a manufacturing plant that utilizes its waste material by putting it back into the cycle potentially by using off cuts from the rubber soles to make more soles instead of merely disposing of them this is dependent on the technical materials not losing their quality as they are reused. Once the shoes have been manufactured they are distributed to retail outlets where the customer buys the shoe at a reduced price because the customer is only paying for the use of the materials in the shoe for the period of time that they will be wearing them. When they outgrow the shoe or it is damaged they return it to the manufacturer. When the manufacturer separates the sole from the upper parts separating the technical and biological nutrients the biological nutrients are returned to the natural environment while the technical nutrients are used to create the sole of another shoe. Another example of CC design is a disposable cup bottle or wrapper made entirely out of biological materials. When the user is finished with the item it can be disposed of and returned to the natural environment the cost of disposal of waste such as landfill and recycling is greatly reduced. The user could also potentially return the item for a refund so it can be used again. Ford Model U is a design concept of a car made completely from cradle to cradle materials. It also uses hydrogen propulsion. The CC model can be applied to almost any system in modern society urban environments buildings manufacturing social systems. steps are outlined in Cradle to Cradle Remaking the way we make things Products that adhere to all steps may be eligible to receive CC certification. Other certifications such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED and Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method BREEAM can be used to qualify for certification and vice versa in the case of BREEAM. CC principles were first applied to systems in the early s by Braungart s Hamburger Umweltinstitut HUI and The Environmental Institute in Brazil for biomass nutrient recycling of effluent to produce agricultural products and clean water as a byproduct. In IE Business School in Madrid launched the Center for Eco Intelligent Innovation in collaboration with William McDonough to study the implementation of Cradle to Cradle design approaches in pioneering businesses. The academic research of companies lead to the elaboration of the Biosphere Rules a set of five principles derived from nature that guide the implementation of circular models in production. In MBDC and the EPEA formed a strategic partnership with global materials consultancy Material ConneXion to help promote and disseminate CC design principles by providing greater global access to CC material information certification and product development. As of January Material ConneXion s Materials Libraries in New York Milan Cologne Bangkok and Daegu Korea started to feature CC assessed and certified materials and in collaboration with MBDC and EPEA the company now offers CC Certification and CC product development. While the CC model has influenced the construction or redevelopment of smaller sites several large organizations and governments have also implemented the CC model and its ideas and concepts The Cradle to Cradle model can be viewed as a framework that considers systems as a whole or holistically. It can be applied to many aspects of human society and is related to Life cycle assessment. See for instance the LCA based model of the Eco costs which has been designed to cope with analyses of recycle systems. The Cradle to Cradle model in some implementations is closely linked with the Car free movement such as in the case of large scale building projects or the construction or redevelopment of urban environments. It is closely linked with passive solar design in the building industry and with permaculture in agriculture within or near urban environments. An earthship is a perfect example where different re use models are used cradle to cradle and permaculture. A major constraint in the optimal recycling of materials is that at civic amenity sites products are not disassembled by hand and have each individual part sorted into a bin but instead have the entire product sorted into a certain bin. This makes the extraction of rare earth elements and other materials uneconomical at recycling sites products typically get crushed after which the materials are extracted by means of magnets chemicals special sorting methods ... and thus optimal recycling of for example metals is impossible an optimal recycling method for metals would require to sort all similar alloys together rather than mixing plain iron with alloys . Obviously disassembling products is not feasible at currently designed civic amenity sites and a better method would be to send back the broken products to the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can disassemble the product. These disassembled product can then be used for making new products or at least to have the components sent separately to recycling sites for proper recycling by the exact type of material . At present though few laws are put in place in any country to oblige manufacturers to take back their products for disassembly nor are there even such obligations for manufacturers of cradle to cradle products. One process where this is happening is in the EU with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Also the European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles DEMETER makes designs of electric motors of which the magnets can be easily removed for recycling the rare earth metals. Criticism has been advanced on the fact that McDonough and Braungart previously kept CC consultancy and certification in their inner circle. Critics argued that this lack of competition prevented the model from fulfilling its potential. Many critics pleaded for a public private partnership overseeing the CC concept thus enabling competition and growth of practical applications and services. McDonough and Braungart responded to this criticism by giving control of the certification protocol to a non profit independent Institute called the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. McDonough said the new institute will enable our protocol to become a public certification program and global standard. The new Institute announced the creation of a Certification Standards Board in June . The new board under the auspices of the Institute will oversee the certification moving forward. Experts in the field of environment protection have questioned the practicability of the concept. Friedrich Schmidt Bleek head of the German Wuppertal Institute called his assertion that the old environmental movement had hindered innovation with its pessimist approach pseudo psychological humbug . I can feel very nice on Michael s seat covers in the airplane. Nevertheless I am still waiting for a detailed proposal for a design of the other . percent of the Airbus after his principles. In Schmidt Bleek stated that it is out of the question that the concept can be realized on a bigger scale. Some claim that CC certification may not be entirely sufficient in all eco design approaches. Quantitative methodologies LCAs and more adapted tools regarding the product type which is considered could be used in tandem. The CC concept ignores the use phase of a product. According to the Variants of Life Cycle Assessment the entire life cycle of a product or service has to be evaluated not only the material itself. For many goods e.g. in transport the use phase has the most influence on the environmental footprint. E.g. the more lightweight a car or a plane the less fuel it consumes and consequently the less impact it has. Braungart fully ignores the use phase. It is safe to say that every production step or resource transformation step needs a certain amount of energy. The CC concept foresees its own certification of its analysis and therefore is in contradiction to international publishing standards ISO and for Life Cycle Assessment whereas an independent external review is needed in order to obtain comparative and resilient results.",FALSE

Interconnected interrelated or interlinked networks channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain. Supply chain management has been defined as the design planning execution control and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value building a competitive infrastructure leveraging worldwide logistics synchronizing supply with demand and measuring performance globally. SCM practice draws heavily from the areas of industrial engineering systems engineering operations management logistics procurement information technology and marketing and strives for an integrated approach. citation needed Marketing channels play an important role in supply chain management. Current research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to sustainability and risk management among others. Some suggest that the people dimension of SCM ethical issues internal integration transparency visibility and human capital talent management are topics that have so far been underrepresented on the research agenda. Supply chain management techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of SC from supplying raw materials to delivering and or resumption of products tries to minimize total costs with respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower inventories are desired to reduce holding costs. In Keith Oliver a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton introduced the term supply chain management to the public domain in an interview for the Financial Times. In the mid s more than a decade later the term supply chain management gained currency when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user as well as the associated information flows. Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage. In the late s supply chain management SCM rose to prominence and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity. Other commonly accepted definitions of supply chain management include A supply chain as opposed to supply chain management is a set of organizations directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products services finances or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain. Supply chain management software includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions manage supplier relationships and control associated business processes. citation needed Supply chain event management SCEM considers all possible events and factors that can disrupt a supply chain. With SCEM possible scenarios can be created and solutions devised. citation needed In many cases the supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling. Including third party logistics or other gathering agencies as part of the RM re patriation process is a way of illustrating the new endgame strategy. citation needed Supply chain management is a cross functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible they reduce their ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply chain management. The purpose of supply chain management is to improve trust and collaboration among supply chain partners thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement. citation needed Organizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains or networks to compete in the global market and networked economy. In Peter Drucker s new management paradigms this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies. In recent decades globalization outsourcing and information technology have enabled many organizations such as Dell and Hewlett Packard to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few key strategic activities. This inter organisational supply network can be acknowledged as a new form of organisation. However with the complicated interactions among the players the network structure fits neither market nor hierarchy categories. It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply network structures could have on firms and little is known about the coordination conditions and trade offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms. Traditionally companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance. In the st century changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply chain networks. First as an outcome of globalization and the proliferation of multinational companies joint ventures strategic alliances and business partnerships significant success factors were identified complementing the earlier just in time lean manufacturing and agile manufacturing practices. Second technological changes particularly the dramatic fall in communication costs a significant component of transaction costs have led to changes in coordination among the members of the supply chain network. Many researchers have recognized supply network structures as a new organisational form using terms such as Keiretsu Extended Enterprise Virtual Corporation Global Production Network and Next Generation Manufacturing System . In general such a structure can be defined as a group of semi independent organisations each with their capabilities which collaborate in ever changing constellations to serve one or more markets in order to achieve some business goal specific to that collaboration . Supply chain management is also important for organizational learning. Firms with geographically more extensive supply chains connecting diverse trading cliques tend to become more innovative and productive. The security management system for supply chains is described in ISO IEC and ISO IEC and related standards published jointly by the ISO and the IEC. Supply Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management logistics procurement and information technology and strives for an integrated approach. Six major movements can be observed in the evolution of supply chain management studies creation integration and globalization specialization phases one and two and SCM .. The term supply chain management was first coined by Keith Oliver in . However the concept of a supply chain in management was of great importance long before in the early th century especially with the creation of the assembly line. The characteristics of this era of supply chain management include the need for large scale changes re engineering downsizing driven by cost reduction programs and widespread attention to Japanese management practices. However the term became widely adopted after the publication of the seminal book Introduction to Supply Chain Management in by Robert B. Handfield and Ernest L. Nichols Jr. which published over copies and was translated into Japanese Korean Chinese and Russian. This era of supply chain management studies was highlighted with the development of electronic data interchange EDI systems in the s and developed through the s by the introduction of enterprise resource planning ERP systems. This era has continued to develop into the st century with the expansion of Internet based collaborative systems. This era of supply chain evolution is characterized by both increasing value added and reducing costs through integration. A supply chain can be classified as a stage or network. In a stage type supply chain systems such as production storage distribution and material control are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage supply chain these are integrated under one plan and enterprise resource planning ERP is enabled. A stage supply chain is one that achieves vertical integration with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example of this kind of supply chain is Tesco. It is the third movement of supply chain management development the globalization era can be characterized by the attention given to global systems of supplier relationships and the expansion of supply chains beyond national boundaries and into other continents. Although the use of global sources in organisations supply chains can be traced back several decades e.g. in the oil industry it was not until the late s that a considerable number of organizations started to integrate global sources into their core business. citation needed This era is characterized by the globalization of supply chain management in organizations with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage adding value and reducing costs through global sourcing. In the s companies began to focus on core competencies and specialization. They abandoned vertical integration sold off non core operations and outsourced those functions to other companies. This changed management requirements as the supply chain extended beyond the company walls and management was distributed across specialized supply chain partnerships. This transition also refocused the fundamental perspectives of each organization. Original equipment manufacturers OEMs became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had to control the entire supply chain from above instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for work in process visibility and vendor managed inventory VMI . The specialization model creates manufacturing and distribution networks composed of several individual supply chains specific to producers suppliers and customers that work together to design manufacture distribute market sell and service a product. This set of partners may change according to a given market region or channel resulting in a proliferation of trading partner environments each with its own unique characteristics and demands. Specialization within the supply chain began in the s with the inception of transportation brokerages warehouse management storage and inventory and non asset based carriers and has matured beyond transportation and logistics into aspects of supply planning collaboration execution and performance management. Market forces sometimes demand rapid changes from suppliers logistics providers locations or customers in their role as components of supply chain networks. This variability has significant effects on supply chain infrastructure from the foundation layers of establishing and managing electronic communication between trading partners to more complex requirements such as the configuration of processes and work flows that are essential to the management of the network itself. Supply chain specialization enables companies to improve their overall competencies in the same way that outsourced manufacturing and distribution has done it allows them to focus on their core competencies and assemble networks of specific best in class partners to contribute to the overall value chain itself thereby increasing overall performance and efficiency. The ability to quickly obtain and deploy this domain specific supply chain expertise without developing and maintaining an entirely unique and complex competency in house is a leading reason why supply chain specialization is gaining popularity. Outsourced technology hosting for supply chain solutions debuted in the late s and has taken root primarily in transportation and collaboration categories. This has progressed from the application service provider ASP model from roughly through to the on demand model from approximately through to the software as a service SaaS model currently in focus today. Building on globalization and specialization the term SCM . has been coined to describe both changes within supply chains themselves as well as the evolution of processes methods and tools to manage them in this new era . The growing popularity of collaborative platforms is highlighted by the rise of TradeCard s supply chain collaboration platform which connects multiple buyers and suppliers with financial institutions enabling them to conduct automated supply chain finance transactions. Web . is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity information sharing and collaboration among users. At its core the common attribute of Web . is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM . replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results a combination of processes methodologies tools and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition rapid price fluctuations changing oil prices short product life cycles expanded specialization near far and off shoring and talent scarcity. Successful SCM requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into key supply chain processes. In an example scenario a purchasing department places orders as its requirements become known. The marketing department responding to customer demand communicates with several distributors and retailers as it attempts to determine ways to satisfy this demand. Information shared between supply chain partners can only be fully leveraged through process integration. Supply chain business process integration involves collaborative work between buyers and suppliers joint product development common systems and shared information. According to Lambert and Cooper operating an integrated supply chain requires a continuous information flow. However in many companies management has concluded that optimizing product flows cannot be accomplished without implementing a process approach. The key supply chain processes stated by Lambert are Much has been written about demand management. Best in class companies have similar characteristics which include the following One could suggest other critical supply business processes that combine these processes stated by Lambert such as Integration of suppliers into the new product development process was shown to have a major impact on product target cost quality delivery and market share. Tapping into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing but also involves managing intellectual property issues. There are gaps in the literature on supply chain management studies at present citation needed there is no theoretical support for explaining the existence or the boundaries of supply chain management. A few authors such as Halldorsson et al. Ketchen and Hult and Lavassani et al. have tried to provide theoretical foundations for different areas related to supply chain by employing organizational theories which may include the following However the unit of analysis of most of these theories is not the supply chain but rather another system such as the firm or the supplier buyer relationship. Among the few exceptions is the relational view which outlines a theory for considering dyads and networks of firms as a key unit of analysis for explaining superior individual firm performance Dyer and Singh . In the study of supply chain management the concept of centroids has become an important economic consideration. A centroid is a location that has a high proportion of a country s population and a high proportion of its manufacturing generally within mi km . In the US two major supply chain centroids have been defined one near Dayton Ohio and a second near Riverside California. The centroid near Dayton is particularly important because it is closest to the population center of the US and Canada. Dayton is within miles of of the US population and manufacturing capacity as well as of Canada s population. The region includes the interchange between I and I one of the busiest in the nation with vehicles passing through per day of which are trucks hauling goods. In addition the I corridor is home to the busiest north south rail route east of the Mississippi River. In Wal Mart announced a big change in its sourcing strategy. Initially Wal Mart relied on intermediaries in the sourcing process. It bought only of its stock directly but the rests were bought through the intermediaries. Therefore the company came to realize that the presence of many intermediaries in the product sourcing was actually increasing the costs in the supply chain. To cut these costs Wall Mart decided to do away with intermediaries in the supply chain and started direct sourcing of its goods from the suppliers. Eduardo Castro Wright the then vice president of Wal Mart set an ambitious goal of buying of all Wal Mart goods directly from the suppliers. Walmart started purchasing fruits and vegetables on a global scale where it interacted directly with the suppliers of these goods. It later engaged the suppliers of other goods such as cloth and home electronics appliances directly and eliminated the importing agents. The purchaser in this case Wal Mart can easily direct the suppliers on how to manufacture certain products so that they can be acceptable to the consumers. Thus Wal Mart through direct sourcing manages to get the exact product quality as it expects since it engages the suppliers in the producing of these products hence quality consistency. Using agents in the sourcing process in most cases lead to inconsistency in the quality of the products since the agent s source the products from different manufacturers which have varying qualities. Wal Mart managed to source directly profit its stock and this has greatly eliminated the intermediaries and cut down the costs between as markups that are introduced by these middlemen in the supply chain hence saving approximately billion. This strategy of direct sourcing not only helped WalMart in reducing the costs in the supply chain but also helped in the improvement of supply chain activities through boosting efficiency throughout the entire process. In other words direct sourcing reduced the time that takes the company to source and stocks the products in its stock. The presence of the intermediaries elongated the time in the process of procurement which sometimes led to delays in the supply of the commodities in the stores thus customers finding empty shelves. Creation of procurement centers WalMart adopted this strategy of sourcing through centralizing the entire process of procurement and sourcing by setting up four global merchandizing points for general goods and clothing. The company instructed all the suppliers to be bringing their products to these central points that are located in different markets. The procurement team assesses the quality brought by the suppliers and buys the goods and distributes them to various regional markets. The procurement and sourcing at centralized places helped the company to consolidate the suppliers. The company has established four centralized points including an office in Mexico City and Canada. Just a mere piloting test on the combining the purchase of fresh apples across the United States Mexico and Canada led to the savings of about . As a result the company intended to increase centralization of its procurement in the North America for all its fresh fruits and vegetables. Thus centralization of the procurement process to various points where the suppliers would be meeting with the procurement team is the latest strategy which the company is implementing and signs show that this strategy is going to cut costs and also improve the efficiency of the procumbent process. Strategic vendor partnerships are another strategy the company is using in the sourcing process. WalMart realized that in order for it to ensure consistency in the quality of the products it offers to the consumers and also maintains a steady supply of goods in its stores at a lower cost it had to create strategic vendor partnerships with the suppliers. WalMart identified and selected the suppliers who met its demand and at the same time offered it the best prices for the goods. It then made a strategic relationship with these vendors by offering and assuring the long term and high volume of purchases in exchange for the lowest possible prices. Thus the company has managed to source its products from same suppliers as bulky but at lower prices. This enables the company to offer competitive prices of its products in its stores hence maintaining a competitive advantage over its competitors whose goods are a little expensive compared to those of WalMart. Efficient communication relationship with the vendor networks to improve the material flow is another sourcing strategy Wal Mart uses. The company has all the contacts with the suppliers whom they communicate regularly and make dates on when the goods would be needed so that the suppliers get ready to deliver the goods in time. The efficient communication between the company s procurement team and the inventory management team enables the company source goods and fill its shelves on time without causing delays and empty shelves. In other words the company realized that in ensuring a steady flow of the goods into the store the suppliers have to be informed early enough so that they can act accordingly to avoid delays in the delivery of goods. Thus efficient communication is another tool which WalMart is using to make the supply chain to be more efficient and cutting the costs. Cross docking is another strategy that WalMart is using to cut costs in its supply chain. Cross docking is the process of transferring goods directly from inbound trucks to outbound trucks. When the trucks of from the suppliers arrive at the distribution centers most of the trucks are not offloaded to keep the goods in the distribution centers or warehouses but they are transferred directly to another truck designated to deliver goods to specific retail stores for sale. Cross docking helps in saving the storage costs. Initially the company was incurring considerable costs of storing the suppliers from the suppliers in its warehouses and the distributions centers to await the distribution trucks to the retail stores in various regions. Tax efficient supply chain management is a business model that considers the effect of tax in the design and implementation of supply chain management. As the consequence of globalization cross national businesses pay different tax rates in different countries. Due to these differences they may legally optimize their supply chain and increase profits based on tax efficiency. failed verification Supply chain sustainability is a business issue affecting an organization s supply chain or logistics network and is frequently quantified by comparison with SECH ratings which uses a triple bottom line incorporating economic social and environmental aspects. SECH ratings are defined as social ethical cultural and health footprints. Consumers have become more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases and companies SECH ratings and along with non governmental organizations NGOs are setting the agenda for transitions to organically grown foods anti sweatshop labor codes and locally produced goods that support independent and small businesses. Because supply chains may account for over of a company s carbon footprint many organizations are exploring ways to reduce this and thus improve their SECH rating. For example in July Wal Mart announced its intentions to create a global sustainability index that would rate products according to the environmental and social impacts of their manufacturing and distribution. The index is intended to create environmental accountability in Wal Mart s supply chain and to provide motivation and infrastructure for other retail companies to do the same. It has been reported that companies are increasingly taking environmental performance into account when selecting suppliers. A survey by the Carbon Trust found that of multinationals expect to select their suppliers based upon carbon performance in the future and of suppliers could lose their places on green supply chains if they do not have adequate performance records on carbon. The US Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law by President Obama in July contained a supply chain sustainability provision in the form of the Conflict Minerals law. This law requires SEC regulated companies to conduct third party audits of their supply chains in order to determine whether any tin tantalum tungsten or gold together referred to as conflict minerals is mined or sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and create a report available to the general public and SEC detailing the due diligence efforts taken and the results of the audit. The chain of suppliers and vendors to these reporting companies will be expected to provide appropriate supporting information. Incidents like the Savar building collapse with more than victims have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first tier suppliers. They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally they highlight that collaboration with local partners across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully managing social responsibility in supply chains. Circular Supply Chain Management CSCM is the configuration and coordination of the organisational functions marketing sales R D production logistics IT finance and customer service within and across business units and organizations to close slow intensify narrow and dematerialise material and energy loops to minimise resource input into and waste and emission leakage out of the system improve its operative effectiveness and efficiency and generate competitive advantages . By reducing resource input and waste leakage along the supply chain and configure it to enable the recirculation of resources at different stages of the product or service lifecycle potential economic and environmental benefits can be achieved. These comprise e.g. a decrease in material and waste management cost and reduced emissions and resource consumption. SCM components are the third element of the four square circulation framework. The level of integration and management of a business process link is a function of the number and level of components added to the link. Consequently adding more management components or increasing the level of each component can increase the level of integration of the business process link. Literature on business process reengineering buyer supplier relationships and SCM suggests various possible components that should receive managerial attention when managing supply relationships. Lambert and Cooper identified the following components However a more careful examination of the existing literature leads to a more comprehensive understanding of what should be the key critical supply chain components or branches of the previously identified supply chain business processes that is what kind of relationship the components may have that are related to suppliers and customers. Bowersox and Closs state that the emphasis on cooperation represents the synergism leading to the highest level of joint achievement. A primary level channel participant is a business that is willing to participate in responsibility for inventory ownership or assume other financial risks thus including primary level components. A secondary level participant specialized is a business that participates in channel relationships by performing essential services for primary participants including secondary level components which support primary participants. Third level channel participants and components that support primary level channel participants and are the fundamental branches of secondary level components may also be included. Consequently Lambert and Cooper s framework of supply chain components does not lead to any conclusion about what are the primary or secondary level specialized supply chain components that is which supply chain components should be viewed as primary or secondary how these components should be structured in order to achieve a more comprehensive supply chain structure and how to examine the supply chain as an integrative one. Reverse logistics is the process of managing the return of goods. It is also referred to as aftermarket customer services . Any time money is taken from a company s warranty reserve or service logistics budget one can speak of a reverse logistics operation. Reverse logistics is also the process of managing the return of goods from store which the returned goods are sent back to warehouse and after that either warehouse scrap the goods or send them back to supplier for replacement depending on the warranty of the merchandise. Supply chain systems configure value for those that organize the networks. Value is the additional revenue over and above the costs of building the network. Co creating value and sharing the benefits appropriately to encourage effective participation is a key challenge for any supply system. Tony Hines defines value as follows Ultimately it is the customer who pays the price for service delivered that confirms value and not the producer who simply adds cost until that point . Global supply chains pose challenges regarding both quantity and value. Supply and value chain trends include These trends have many benefits for manufacturers because they make possible larger lot sizes lower taxes and better environments e.g. culture infrastructure special tax zones or sophisticated OEM for their products. There are many additional challenges when the scope of supply chains is global. This is because with a supply chain of a larger scope the lead time is much longer and because there are more issues involved such as multiple currencies policies and laws. The consequent problems include different currencies and valuations in different countries different tax laws different trading protocols vulnerability to natural disasters and cyber threats and lack of transparency of cost and profit. Supply chain consulting is the providing of expert knowledge in order to assess the productivity of a supply chain and ideally to enhance the productivity. Supply chain Consulting is a service involved in transfer of knowledge on how to exploit existing assets through improved coordination and can hence be a source of competitive advantage Hereby the role of the consultant is to help management by adding value to the whole process through the various sectors from the ordering of the raw materials to the final product. On this regard firms either build internal teams of consultants to tackle the issue or use external ones companies choose between these two approaches taking into consideration various factors . The use of external consultants is a common practice among companies. The whole consulting process generally involves the analysis of the entire supply chain process including the countermeasures or correctives to take to achieve a better overall performance. Supply chain professionals need to have knowledge of managing supply chain functions such as transportation warehousing inventory management and production planning. In the past supply chain professionals emphasized logistics skills such as knowledge of shipping routes familiarity with warehousing equipment and distribution center locations and footprints and a solid grasp of freight rates and fuel costs. More recently supply chain management extends to logistical support across firms and management of global supply chains. Supply chain professionals need to have an understanding of business continuity basics and strategies. Supply chain professionals play major roles in the design and management of supply chains. In the design of supply chains they help determine whether a product or service is provided by the firm itself insourcing or by another firm elsewhere outsourcing . In the management of supply chains supply chain professionals coordinate production among multiple providers ensuring that production and transport of goods happen with minimal quality control or inventory problems. One goal of a well designed and maintained supply chain for a product is to successfully build the product at minimal cost. Such a supply chain could be considered a competitive advantage for a firm. Beyond design and maintenance of a supply chain itself supply chain professionals participate in aspects of business that have a bearing on supply chains such as sales forecasting quality management strategy development customer service and systems analysis. Production of a good may evolve over time rendering an existing supply chain design obsolete. Supply chain professionals need to be aware of changes in production and business climate that affect supply chains and create alternative supply chains as the need arises. Individuals working in supply chain management can attain a professional certification by passing an exam developed by a third party certification organizations. The purpose of certification is to guarantee a certain level of expertise in the field. The knowledge needed to pass a certification exam may be gained from several sources. Some knowledge may come from college courses but most of it is acquired from a mix of on the job learning experiences attending industry events learning best practices with their peers and reading books and articles in the field. Certification organizations may provide certification workshops tailored to their exams. There are also free websites that provide a significant amount of educational articles as well as blogs that are internationally recognized which provide good sources of news and updates. The following North American universities rank high in their master s education in the SCM World University ranking which was published in and which is based on the opinions of supply chain managers Michigan State University Penn State University University of Tennessee Massachusetts Institute of Technology Arizona State University University of Texas at Austin and Western Michigan University. In the same ranking the following European universities rank high Cranfield School of Management Vlerick Business School INSEAD Cambridge University Eindhoven University of Technology London Business School and Copenhagen Business School. In the Eduniversal Best Masters Ranking Supply Chain and Logistics the following universities rank high Massachusetts Institute of Technology KEDGE Business School Purdue University Rotterdam School of Management Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru Universidade Nova de Lisboa Vienna University of Economics and Business and Copenhagen Business School. There are a number of organizations that provide certification exams such as CSCMP Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals IIPMR International Institute for Procurement and Market Research APICS the Association for Operations Management ISCEA The International Supply Chain Education Alliance and IoSCM Institute of Supply Chain Management . APICS certification is called Certified Supply Chain Professional or CSCP and ISCEA S certification is called the Certified Supply Chain Manager CSCM CISCM Chartered Institute of Supply Chain Management awards certificate as Chartered Supply Chain Management Professional CSCMP .

"42",42,"waste minimisation","/wiki/Waste_minimisation",TRUE,0,"practice|process|waste|","Waste minimisation is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of waste produced"," Waste minimisation is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of waste produced. By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more sustainable society. Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and or changing societal patterns of consumption and production. The most environmentally resourceful economically efficient and cost effective way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most waste management strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources therefore the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective safe and sustainable manner. Traditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created concentrating on re use recycling and waste to energy conversion. Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing. To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process cradle to grave analysis the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth and details of the composition of the waste. The main sources of waste vary from country to country. In the UK most waste comes from the construction and demolition of buildings followed by mining and quarrying industry and commerce. Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste. Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the supply chain. For example a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs. Waste minimisation can protect the environment and often turns out to have positive economic benefits. Waste minimisation can improve In industry using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products. Waste minimisation efforts often require investment which is usually compensated by the savings. However waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part. Waste minimisation and resource maximisation for manufactured products can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of components used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life. In some cases it may be best not to minimise the volume of raw materials used to make a product but instead reduce the volume or toxicity of the waste created at the end of a product s life or the environmental impact of the product s use. See section Durability . In this strategy products and packages are optimally designed to meet their intended use. This applies especially to packaging materials which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand it could be more wasteful if food which has consumed resources and energy in its production is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of paper metals glass and plastics in its packaging. Improving product durability such as extending a vacuum cleaner s useful life to years instead of can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation. But in some cases it has a negative environmental impact. If a product is too durable its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed. Therefore extending an older machine s useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it recycling its metal and buying a new model. Similarly older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts. Most proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste. Making refillable glass bottles strong enough to withstand several journeys between the consumer and the bottling plant requires making them thicker and so heavier which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make. If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey.. Many choices involve trade offs of environmental impact and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions. Various aspects of business practices affect waste such as the use of disposable tableware in restaurants. Reusable bags are a visible form of re use and some stores offer a bag credit for re usable shopping bags although at least one chain reversed its policy claiming it was just a temporary bonus . In contrast one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount. . Of note the before after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax. While there is a minor inconvenience involved this may remedy itself as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries. This section details some waste minimisation techniques for householders. Appropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also if a pack or can is to be thrown away any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled. Home composting the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation. The resources that households use can be reduced considerably by using electricity thoughtfully e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions. In a domestic situation the potential for minimisation is often dictated by lifestyle. Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow fashion trends when the older products are still usable. Adults working full time have little free time and so may have to purchase more convenient foods that require little preparation or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family. The amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes. Yet influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total resource consumption. Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have eco labelling which is currently not mandatory or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the UK PullApart combines both environmental and consumer packaging surveys in a curbside packaging recycling classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available consumers can be proactive and use them. Health care establishments are massive producers of waste. The major sources of health care waste are hospitals laboratories and research centres mortuary and autopsy centres animal research and testing laboratories blood banks and collection services and nursing homes for the elderly. Waste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste. Good management and control practices among health care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day. There are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities Source reduction Management and control measures at hospital level Stock management of chemical and pharmaceutical products",FALSE

PSS models are emerging as a means to enable collaborative consumption of both products and services with the aim of pro environmental outcomes. Product service systems put simply are when a firm offers a mix of both products and services in comparison to the traditional focus on products. As defined by van Halen te Riele Goedkoop a marketable set of products and services capable of jointly fulfilling a user s needs PSSes can be realized by smart products. The initial move to PSS was largely motivated by the need on the part of traditional manufacturing firms to cope with changing market forces and the recognition that services in combination with products could provide higher profits than products alone. Faced with shrinking markets and increased commoditization of their products these firms saw service provision as a new path towards profits and growth. While not all product service systems result in the reduction of material consumption they are more widely being recognized as an important part of a firm s environmental strategy. citation needed timeframe In fact some researchers have redefined PSS as necessarily including improved environmental improvement. For example Mont defines PSS as a system of products services supporting networks and infrastructure that is designed to be competitive satisfy customers needs and have a lower environmental impact than traditional business models. Mont elaborates on her definition as follows A PSS is a pre designed system of products service supporting infrastructures and necessary networks that is a so called dematerialized solution to consumer preferences and needs. It has also been defined as a self learning system one of whose goals is continual improvement. This view of PSS is similar to other concepts commonly seen in the environmental management literature such as dematerialization and servicizing . PSS has been used to create value for customers beyond selling products as functions. Typically there are four approaches to PSS design. citation needed specify There are many methodologies on PSS design. Dominant Innovation system uses an Innovation Matrix to identified gaps from customer s fear not needs based on scenario based path finding. A new value chain ecosystem can be further developed to link these gaps between two invisible spaces. For example John Deere developed Agric Service business based on the customers worries on soil related issues. It integrates sensors with GPS to develop cognitive site map about soil content to optimize crop yields. In addition Komatsu Japan used remote maintenance system Komtrax system and further integrated with intelligent analytics for proactive maintenance. In recent years timeframe PSS has been further integrated with big data analytics for accelerated innovation. Other technologies such as prognostics health management and cyber physical systems have further created service innovation technologies for PSS. For example Alstom has been developing Train Tracer technologies clarification needed since and is implementing Health Hub system clarification needed for its transport fleets. In addition NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center on Intelligent Maintenance Systems IMS has been developing predictive analytics for aircraft engines machine tools robots as well as wind turbines etc. for expanded e maintenance or cybermaintenance systems. Servicizing is a transaction through which value is provided by a combination of products and services in which the satisfaction of customer needs is achieved either by selling the function of the product rather than the product itself or by increasing the service component of a product offer. The concept is based on the idea that what customers want from products is not necessarily ownership but rather the function that the product provides or the service the product can deliver. This means that the provider of servicizing solutions may get paid by the unit of service or product function delivered as opposed to the more traditional unit of products sold. See service economy for more on the servitization of products. One type of servicizing solutions is based on transactions where payment is made not for the product but for the product service package part of PSS which has been sold to the customer. This servicized purchase extends the buying transaction from a one time sale product acquisition to a long term service relationship such as in the case of a long term maintenance free service contract . Another type of servicizing may be a strategy for providing access to services for people who cannot afford to buy products outright. For example in the case where auto ownership is economically unfeasible creative servicizing offers at least three possible solutions one in which transportation can be achieved simultaneously as in car pooling one in which transportation can be achieved sequentially as in car sharing and one in which transportation can be achieved eventually rent to own . There are various issues in the nomenclature of the discussion of PSS not least that services are products and need material products in order to support delivery however it has been a major focus of research for several years. The research has focussed on a PSS as system comprising tangibles the products and intangibles the services in combination for fulfilling specific customer needs. The research has shown that manufacturing firms are more amenable to producing results rather than solely products as specific artefacts and that consumers are more amenable to consuming such results. This research has identified three classes of PSS .mw parser output .smallcaps font variant small caps Van Ostaeyen et al. criticize this typology for failing to capture the complexity of PSS examples found in practice. They propose an alternative that categorizes PSS types according to two distinguishing features the performance orientation of the dominant revenue mechanism and the degree of integration between product and service elements. According to the first distinguishing feature a PSS can be designated as input based IB availability based AB usage based UB or performance based PB . The performance based type can be further subdivided into three subtypes According to the second distinguishing feature a PSS can be designated as segregated semi integrated and integrated depending on to what extent the product and service elements e.g. maintenance service spare parts are combined into a single offering. The following existing offerings illustrate the PSS concept In the framework of the European research program of TURAS Transitioning towards urban resilience and sustainability a study in Belgium explored new hybrid combinations between products and services systems in order to develop new creative and sustainable business opportunities both economically viable and creating new jobs for the Brussels Capital Region. Five workshops have been organized on the following topics After co creation workshops with more than different stakeholders and the use of specifics tools PSS inspiring and promising ideas were identified. After a selection process were chosen for further development of their business models through a series of tools debugging light experimentation simulation etc. . The study led to the development of a practical toolkit freely downloadable PSS Toolkit Development of innovative business models for product service systems in an urban context of sustainable transition. Several authors assert that product service systems will improve eco efficiency by what is termed factor i.e. an improvement by a factor of times or more by enabling new and radical ways of transforming what they call the product service mix that satisfy consumer demands while also improving the effects upon the environment. van Halen et al. state that the knowledge of PSS enables both governments to formulate policy with respect to sustainable production and consumption patterns and companies to discover directions for business growth innovation diversification and renewal. Tietze and Hansen discuss the impact of PSS on firms innovation behavior identifying three determinants. First product ownership is not transferred to the customers but remains with the PSS operating firm. Second the purpose of a product is different if it is used within PSS solutions than compared to the purpose of products in classical transaction based business models. When offering PSS products are used as a means for offering a service. Third the profit function of PSS operating firms differs substantially from profit functions of firms that develop manufacture and sell their products. From a manufacturer s perspective the business potential of a PSS is determined by an interplay of four mechanisms cost reduction increased customer value changes to the company s competitive environment and an expansion of the customer base.",FALSE

It provides researchers with a metaphorical framework to study the interactions of natural and human systems in specific regions. From the beginning researchers have tweaked and altered the parameters of the urban metabolism model. C. Kennedy and fellow researchers have produced a clear definition in the paper The Changing Metabolism of Cities claiming that urban metabolism is the sum total of the technical and socio economic process that occur in cities resulting in growth production of energy and elimination of waste. With the growing concern of climate change and atmospheric degradation the use of the urban metabolism model has become a key element in determining and maintaining levels of sustainability and health in cities around the world. Urban metabolism provides a unified or holistic viewpoint to encompass all of the activities of a city in a single model. With deep roots in sociology Karl Marx and fellow researcher Friedrich Engels may have been the first to raise concerns around issues which we would now call urban metabolism. Marx and Engels concentrated on the social organization of the harvesting of the Earth s materials by analysing the dynamic internal relationships between humans and nature. Marx used the metaphor of metabolism to refer to the actual metabolic interactions that take place through humans exertion of physical labour to cultivate the Earth for sustenance and shelter. In short Marx and Engels found that when humans exerted such physical labour they ultimately altered the biophysical processes as well. This acknowledgement of altering the biophysical landscape is the first stepping stone for the creation of urban metabolism within social geography. They also used metabolism to describe the material and energy exchange between nature and society in as a critique of industrialization which created an interdependent set of societal needs brought into play through the concrete organization of human labour. Marx advocated that urban metabolism becomes a power in itself like capitalism and will control society unless society is able to control it. Later in reaction against industrialization and coal use Sir Patrick Geddes a Scottish biologist undertook an ecological critique of urbanization in making him the first scientist to attempt an empirical description of societal metabolism on a macroeconomic scale. Through his experimental study of urbanization he established a physical budget for urban energy and material throughput by way of an input output table. It wasn t until when Abel Wolman fully developed and used the term urban metabolism in his work The Metabolism of Cities which he developed in response to deteriorating air and water qualities in American cities. In this study Wolman developed a model which allowed him to determine the inflow and outflow rates of a hypothetical American City with a population of million people. The model allows the monitoring and documentation of natural resources used mainly water and the consequential creation and out put of waste. Wolman s study highlighted the fact that there are physical limitations to the natural resources we use on a day to day basis and with frequent use the compilation of waste can and will create problems. It also helped focus researchers and professionals of their time to focus their attention on the system wide impacts of consumption of goods and sequential production of waste within the urban environment. Working off of Wolman s pioneering work in the s environmentalist Herbert Girardet began to see and document his findings in the connection between urban metabolism and sustainable cities. Girardet laid the foundation for the industrial ecology approach to urban metabolism in which it is seen as the conversion of nature into society. Aside from being a great advocate and populariser for urban metabolism Girardet significantly coined and drew the difference between a circular and linear metabolism. In a circular cycle there is nearly no waste and almost everything is re used. Girardet characterizes this as a natural world process. On the other hand a linear metabolism which is characterized as an urban world process has a clear resource in put and waste out put. Girardet emphasizes that the accelerated use of linear metabolisms in urban environments is creating an impending global crisis as cities grow. More recently the metabolism frame of reference has been used in the reporting of environmental information in Australia where researchers such as Newman have begun to link urban metabolic measures to and it has been suggested that it can be used to define the sustainability of a city within the ecosystems capacity that can support it. This research has stayed mainly at a descriptive level and did not reach into the political or social forces of urban form and stages of flow. From this research there has been a strong theme in present literature on urban sustainability is that of the need to view the urban system as a whole if we are to best understand and solve the complex problems. Developed in s Howard T. Odum a systems ecologist wanted to emphasize the dependence on the source of almost all energy on the planet the sun. Odum believed that previous research and development on urban metabolism was missing and did not account for qualitative differences of mass or energy flows. Odum s study took this into count and he coined the term energy to track and account for the metabolic flows by measuring the solar energy used directly or indirectly to make a product or deliver a service. This method also emphasizes the use of a standard unit of measurement to calculate energy nutrient and waste movement in the biophysical system the unit chosen was solar energy joules . At first glance the notion to use standard units seems like a beneficial idea for calculating and comparing figures in reality the ability to convert all urban processes into solar energy joules has proven to be a difficult feat and difficult to understand. Currently the Urban Metabolism UM approach as deducted from international literature has been applied several times to assess and describe urban flows and impacts related to them using different tools such as Material Flow Analysis MFA Ioppolo et al. . The MFA researched by Baccinni and Brunner in the s measures the materials flowing into a system the stocks and flows within it and the resulting outputs from the system to other systems in the form of pollution waste or exports. Much like Wolmans case model for a hypothetical American City this method is based on the concept that the mass of the resources used will equal the mass plus stock changes out. The MFA technique has become the mainstream school of urban metabolism because it uses more practical units that the public workers government officials and researchers can understand. There are four main uses of urban metabolism that are used today by urban planners and designers sustainability reporting urban greenhouse gas accounting mathematical modelling for policy analysis and urban design. With the issue of sustainability at the core of many environmental issues today one of the main uses of Urban Metabolism in the modern era is to track and record levels of sustainability in cities and regions around the world. Urban metabolism collects important and very useful information about energy efficiency material cycling waste management and infrastructure in urban environments. The urban metabolism model records and analyzes environmental conditions and trends which are easily understood for policy makers and consequently comparable over time making it easier to find unhealthy patterns and develop a plan of action to better the level of sustainability. Staying in line with the notion of sustainability urban metabolism is also a helpful tool for tracking greenhouse gas emissions on a city or regional level. As mentioned above with the proliferation of linear metabolisms such as cars the production of greenhouse gases has increased exponentially since the birth and mass production of the automobile causing a problem for our atmosphere. Urban metabolism has been proven to be a necessary tool for measuring levels of greenhouse gas because it is an out put or waste product that is produced through human consumption. The model provides quantifiable parameters which allow officials to mark unhealthy levels of GHG emissions and again develop a plan of action to lower them. Aside from the two accounting applications above urban metabolism has begun to develop mathematical models to quantify and predict levels of particles and nutrients within the urban metabolism model. Such models have mostly been created and used by MFA scholars and are helpful in determining present and future sub processes and material stocks and flows within the urban environment With the ability to predict future levels these mathematical models allow progress to be made and possible pollution prevention programs to be instated rather than end of the pipe solutions which have been favoured in the past. Through utilization of the applications above scholars and professionals are able to use urban metabolism as a design tool to create greener and more sustainable infrastructure from the beginning. By tracing flows of energy materials and waste through urban systems as a whole changes and alterations can be made to close the loops to create circular metabolisms where resources are recycled and almost no waste is produced. Such initiatives are being made around the world with technology and inventions which make building green that much easier and accessible.",FALSE
"45",45,"Landfill mining","/wiki/Landfill_mining",TRUE,0,"process|waste|","Landfill mining and reclamation LFMR is a process whereby solid wastes which have previously been landfilled are excavated and processed","Landfill mining and reclamation LFMR is a process whereby solid wastes which have previously been landfilled are excavated and processed. The function of landfill mining is to reduce the amount of landfill mass encapsulated within the closed landfill and or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the landfill mass is replaced. In the process mining recovers valuable recyclable materials a combustible fraction soil and landfill space. The aeration of the landfill soil is a secondary benefit regarding the landfill s future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the landfill mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system. The operating principle is to excavate sieve and sort the landfill material. The concept of mining was introduced as early as at the Hiriya landfill operated by the Dan Region Authority next to the city of Tel Aviv Israel. Waste contains many resources with high value the most notable of which are non ferrous metals such as aluminium cans and scrap metal. The concentration of aluminium in many landfills is higher than the concentration of aluminum in bauxite from which the metal is derived. Landfill mining is also possible in countries where land is not available for new landfill sites. In this instance landfill space can be reclaimed by the extraction of biodegradable waste and other substances then refilled with wastes requiring disposal. Mining construction landfill sites is the simplest form of landfill mining. Construction landfills in the United States contain three basic components wood scrap metal and gypsum or drywall along with a minimal amount of other construction materials. The wood collected can be used as fuel in coal burning power plants and the scrap metal reprocessed. European landfills tend to have more masonry from demolished bricks tiles and concrete. Mining of municipal landfills is more complicated and has to be based on the expected content of the landfill. Older landfills in the United States before were often capped and closed essentially entombing the waste. This can be beneficial for waste recovery. It can also create a higher risk for toxic waste and leachate exposure as the landfill has not fully processed the stewing wastes. Mining of bioreactor landfills and properly stabilized modern sanitary landfills provides its own benefits. The biodegradable wastes are more easily sieved out leaving the non biodegradable materials readily accessible. The quality of these materials for recycling and reprocessing purposes is not as high as initially recycled materials however materials such as aluminum and steel are usually excluded from this. Landfill mining is most useful as a method to remediate hazardous landfills. Landfills that were established before landfill liner technology was well established often leak their unprocessed leachate into underlying aquifers. This is both an environmental hazard and also a legal liability. In the US the Environmental Protection Agency requires closed landfills to be monitored for at least years after waste placement ceases. Mining the landfill simply to lay a safe liner is a last but sometimes necessary resort. The parts of the mining process are the different mining machines. Depending on the complexity of the process more or fewer machines can be used. Machinery is easily transported on trucks from site to site mounted on trailers. An excavator or front end loader uncovers the landfilled materials and places them on a moving floor conveyor belt to be taken to the sorting machinery. A trommel is used to separate materials by size. First a large trommel separates materials like appliances and fabrics. A smaller trommel then allows the biodegraded soil fraction to pass through leaving non biodegradable recyclable materials on the screen to be collected. An electromagnet is used to remove the ferrous material from the waste mass as it passes along the conveyor belt. A front end loader is used to move sorted materials to trucks for further processing. Odor control sprayers are wheeled tractors with a cab and movable spray arm mounted on a rotating platform. A large reservoir tank mounted behind the cab holds neutralizing agents usually in liquid form to reduce the smell of exposed wastes. Depending on the level of resource recovery material can be put through an air classifier which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded by front end loaders onto trucks either for further processing or for sale. Further manual processing can be done on site if processing facilities are too far away to justify the transportation costs.",FALSE

The term D printing covers a variety of processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three dimensional object with material being added together such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together typically layer by layer. In the s D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetical prototypes and a more appropriate term was rapid prototyping . As of update the precision repeatability and material range have increased to the point that some D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial production technology whereby the term additive manufacturing can be used synonymously with D printing . One of the key advantages of D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries and a prerequisite for producing any D printed part is a digital D model or a CAD file. The most commonly used D printing process as of update is a material extrusion technique called fused deposition modeling FDM . The term D printing originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. More recently the popular vernacular has started using the term to encompass a wider variety of additive manufacturing techniques such as Electron beam melting and Selective laser melting. The United States and global technical standards use the official need quotation to verify term additive manufacturing for this broader sense. The umbrella term additive manufacturing AM gained popularity in the s inspired by the theme of material being added together in any of various ways . In contrast the term subtractive manufacturing appeared as a retronym for the large family of machining processes with material removal as their common theme. The term D printing still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds and the term AM was more likely to be used in metalworking and end use part production contexts than among polymer ink jet or stereo lithography enthusiasts. By early s the terms D printing and additive manufacturing evolved senses in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies one being used in popular language by consumer maker communities and the media and the other used more formally by industrial end use part producers machine manufacturers and global technical standards organizations. Until recently the term D printing has been associated with machines low in price or in capability. D printing and additive manufacturing reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski the editor in chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine pointed out in that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage but some manufacturing industry experts are trying to make a distinction whereby Additive Manufacturing comprises D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process. Other terms that have been used as synonyms or hypernyms have included desktop manufacturing rapid manufacturing as the logical production level successor to rapid prototyping and on demand manufacturing which echoes on demand printing in the D sense of printing . Such application of the adjectives rapid and on demand to the noun manufacturing was novel in the s reveals the prevailing mental model of the long industrial era in which almost all production manufacturing involved long lead times for laborious tooling development. Today the term subtractive has not replaced the term machining instead complementing it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or D printing methods to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost effective and high quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs and it can be used in hydro forming stamping injection molding and other manufacturing processes. Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the s. In Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three dimensional plastic models with photo hardening thermoset polymer where the UV exposure area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter. On July Alain Le Mhaut Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr filed their patent for the stereolithography process. The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company now Alcatel Alsthom and CILAS The Laser Consortium . The claimed reason was for lack of business perspective . Three weeks later in Chuck Hull of D Systems Corporation filed his own patent for a stereolithography fabrication system in which layers are added by curing photopolymers with ultraviolet light lasers. Hull defined the process as a system for generating three dimensional objects by creating a cross sectional pattern of the object to be formed . Hull s contribution was the STL Stereolithography file format and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today. The technology used by most D printers to date especially hobbyist and consumer oriented models is fused deposition modeling a special application of plastic extrusion developed in by S. Scott Crump and commercialized by his company Stratasys which marketed its first FDM machine in . AM processes for metal sintering or melting such as selective laser sintering direct metal laser sintering and selective laser melting usually went by their own individual names in the s and s. At the time all metalworking was done by processes that are now called non additive casting fabrication stamping and machining although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies such as by robot welding and CNC the idea of a tool or head moving through a D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal rather than adding it such as CNC milling CNC EDM and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal which would later be called additive manufacturing were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid s new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common enabling new object geometries. The term D printing originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom inkjet print heads developed at MIT in and commercialized by Soligen Technologies Extrude Hone Corporation and Z Corporation. The year also saw the start of a company called Solidscape introducing a high precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures categorized as a dot on dot technique . In the Fraunhofer Institute developed the selective laser melting process. Fused Deposition Modeling FDM printing process patents expired in . As the various additive processes matured it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer. The s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets and large nuts would be grown either before or instead of machining in job production rather than obligately being machined from bar stock or plate. It is still the case that casting fabrication stamping and machining are more prevalent than additive manufacturing in metalworking but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing it is clear to engineers that much more is to come. As technology matured several authors had begun to speculate that D printing could aid in sustainable development in the developing world. Filabot develops a system for closing the loop with plastic and allows for any FDM or FFF D printer to be able to print with a wider range of plastics. Georgia Institute of Technology Dr. Benjamin S. Cook and Dr. Manos M. Tentzeris demonstrate the first multi material vertically integrated printed electronics additive manufacturing platform VIPRE which enabled D printing of functional electronics operating up to GHz. D printable models may be created with a computer aided design CAD package via a D scanner or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software. D printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors and can be corrected before printing allowing verification in the design of the object before it is printed. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object creating a digital model based on it. CAD models can be saved in the stereolithography file format STL a de facto CAD file format for additive manufacturing that stores data based on triangulations of the surface of CAD models. STL is not tailored for additive manufacturing because it generates large file sizes of topology optimized parts and lattice structures due to the large number of surfaces involved. A newer CAD file format the Additive Manufacturing File format AMF was introduced in to solve this problem. It stores information using curved triangulations. Before printing a D model from an STL file it must first be examined for errors. Most CAD applications produce errors in output STL files of the following types A step in the STL generation known as repair fixes such problems in the original model. Generally STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through D scanning often have more of these errors. This is due to how D scanning works as it is often by point to point acquisition D reconstruction will include errors in most cases. Once completed the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a slicer which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of D printer FDM printers . This G code file can then be printed with D printing client software which loads the G code and uses it to instruct the D printer during the D printing process . Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X Y resolution in dots per inch dpi or micrometers m . Typical layer thickness is around m DPI although some machines can print layers as thin as m DPI . X Y resolution is comparable to that of laser printers. The particles D dots are around to m to DPI in diameter. citation needed For that printer resolution specifying a mesh resolution of . . mm and a chord length . mm generate an optimal STL output file for a given model input file. Specifying higher resolution results in larger files without increase in print quality. Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model. Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously. Traditional techniques like injection moulding can be less expensive for manufacturing polymer products in high quantities but additive manufacturing can be faster more flexible and less expensive when producing relatively small quantities of parts. D printers give designers and concept development teams the ability to produce parts and concept models using a desktop size printer. Though the printer produced resolution is sufficient for many applications greater accuracy can be achieved by printing a slightly oversized version of the desired object in standard resolution and then removing material using a higher resolution subtractive process. The layered structure of all Additive Manufacturing processes leads inevitably to a strain stepping effect on part surfaces which are curved or tilted in respect to the building platform. The effects strongly depend on the orientation of a part surface inside the building process. Some printable polymers such as ABS allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes based on acetone or similar solvents. Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials in the course of constructing parts. These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously and would not necessarily require painting. Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built for overhanging features during construction. These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved upon completion of the print. All of the commercialized metal D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition. A new process for the GMAW D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove aluminum or steel. Multi material printing allows objects to be composed of complex and heterogeneous arrangements of materials. It requires a material being directly specified for each voxel inside the object volume. The process is fraught with difficulties due to the isolated and monolithic algorithms. There are many different ways to solve these problems such as building a SpecFab translator. Or use microstructures to Control Elasticity in D Printing. There is also a solution about how to print a Multi material d painting Deep Multispectral Painting Reproduction via Multi Layer Custom Ink Printing. Multi material D printing is a fundamental element for development of future technology. It has been already applied to variable industries. Other than common applications in small manufacturing industries to produce toys shoes furniture phone cases instruments or even artworks. With the BAAM Big Area Additive Manufacturing machine large products such as D printed houses or cars are quite feasible. It has also been widely used in high tech industries. Researchers are devoting to producing high temperature tools with BAAM for aerospace applications. In medical industry a concept of D printed pills and vaccines has been recently brought up. With this new concept multiple medications are capable of being united together which accordingly will decrease many risks. With more and more applications of multi material D printing the costs of daily life and high technology development will become irreversibly lower. Metallographic materials of D printing is also being researched. By classifying each material CIMP D can systematically perform D printing with multi materials. There are many different branded D printing processes that can be grouped into seven categories The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object. Others sometimes use standard off the shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed costs of the D printer of the printed prototype choice and cost of the materials and color capabilities. Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold which is then used to make metal parts. ISO ASTM defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing AM processes within its meaning binder jetting directed energy deposition material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion sheet lamination and vat photopolymerization. Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication also known as Fused deposition modeling FDM the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic metal wire or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head D printer extruder which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Recently FFF FDM has expanded to D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament. This process is called fused particle fabrication FPF or fused granular fabrication FGF and has the potential to use more recycled materials. Powder Bed Fusion techniques or PBF include several processes such as DMLS SLS SLM MJF and EBM. Powder Bed Fusion processes can be used with an array of materials and their flexibility allows for geometrically complex structures making it a go to choice for many D printing projects. These techniques include selective laser sintering with both metals and polymers and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts e.g. titanium alloys . EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet D printing system which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder plaster or resins and printing a binder in the cross section of the part using an inkjet like process. With laminated object manufacturing thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. In addition to the previously mentioned methods HP has developed the Multi Jet Fusion MJF which is a powder base technique though no laser are involved. An inkjet array applies fusing and detailing agents which are then combined by heating to create a solid layer. Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra thin layers between and m until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately without post curing. Ultra small features can be made with the D micro fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under nm are easily produced as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask image projection based stereolithography a D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light the window which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. In powder fed directed energy deposition a high power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment. As of December additive manufacturing systems were on the market that ranged from to in price and were employed in industries including aerospace architecture automotive defense and medical replacements among many others. For example General Electric uses high end D Printers to build parts for turbines. Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping before mass production methods are employed. Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator. Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller D printers for educational and community access. Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable D printers for home desktop use. Much of this work has been driven by and targeted at DIY Maker enthusiast early adopter communities with additional ties to the academic and hacker communities. Computed axial lithography is a method for D printing based on computerised tomography scans to create prints in photo curable resin. It was developed by a collaboration between the University of California Berkeley with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Unlike other methods of D printing it does not build models through depositing layers of material like fused deposition modelling and stereolithography instead it creates objects using a series of D images projected onto a cylinder of resin. It is notable for its ability to build an object much more quickly than other methods using resins and the ability to embed objects within the prints. Liquid additive manufacturing LAM is an additive manufacturing technique which deposits a liquid or high viscose material e.g Liquid Silicone Rubber onto a build surface to create an object which then vulcanised using heat to harden the object. The process was originally created by Adrian Bowyer and was then built upon by German RepRap. In the current scenario D printing or Additive Manufacturing has been used in manufacturing medical industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate D printing or Additive Manufacturing to become successful commercial technology. More recently D printing has also been used in the humanitarian and development sector to produce a range of medical items prosthetics spares and repairs. The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the toolroom end of the manufacturing spectrum. For example rapid prototyping was one of the earliest additive variants and its mission was to reduce the lead time and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling turning and precision grinding. In the s additive manufacturing entered production to a much greater extent. Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food layer by layer into three dimensional objects. A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates such as chocolate and candy and flat foods such as crackers pasta and pizza. NASA is looking into the technology in order to create D printed food to limit food waste and to make food that are designed to fit an astronaut s dietary needs. In Italian bioengineer Giuseppe Scionti developed a technology allowing to generate fibrous plant based meat analogues using a custom D bioprinter mimicking meat texture and nutritional values. D printing has entered the world of clothing with fashion designers experimenting with D printed bikinis shoes and dresses. In commercial production Nike is using D printing to prototype and manufacture the Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football and New Balance is D manufacturing custom fit shoes for athletes. D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer grade eyewear with on demand custom fit and styling although they cannot print the lenses . On demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping. Vanessa Friedman fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times says D printing will have a significant value for fashion companies down the road especially if it transforms into a print it yourself tool for shoppers. There s real sense that this is not going to happen anytime soon she says but it will happen and it will create dramatic change in how we think both about intellectual property and how things are in the supply chain. She adds Certainly some of the fabrications that brands can use will be dramatically changed by technology. In cars trucks and aircraft Additive Manufacturing is beginning to transform both unibody and fuselage design and production and powertrain design and production. For example AM s impact on firearms involves two dimensions new manufacturing methods for established companies and new possibilities for the making of do it yourself firearms. In the US based group Defense Distributed disclosed plans to design a working plastic D printed firearm that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a D printer. After Defense Distributed released their plans questions were raised regarding the effects that D printing and widespread consumer level CNC machining may have on gun control effectiveness. Surgical uses of D printing centric therapies have a history beginning in the mid s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning. Patient matched implants were a natural extension of this work leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual. Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using D printed personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success. One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia developed at the University of Michigan. The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants metals is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration. The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest area of future development using the custom D printing technology. In March surgeons in Swansea used D printed parts to rebuild the face of a motorcyclist who had been seriously injured in a road accident. In May D printing has been used for the kidney transplant to save a three year old boy. As of update D bio printing technology has been studied by biotechnology firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet printing techniques. In this process layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three dimensional structures including vascular systems. Recently a heart on chip has been created which matches properties of cells. In D printing computer simulated microstructures are commonly used to fabricate objects with spatially varying properties. This is achieved by dividing the volume of the desired object into smaller subcells using computer aided simulation tools and then filling these cells with appropriate microstructures during fabrication. Several different candidate structures with similar behaviours are checked against each other and the object is fabricated when an optimal set of structures are found. Advanced topology optimization methods are used to ensure the compatibility of structures in adjacent cells. This flexible approach to D fabrication is widely used across various disciplines from biomedical sciences where they are used to create complex bone structures and human tissue to robotics where they are used in the creation of soft robots with movable parts. In D printing technology was used for the first time to create a matrix for cell immobilization in fermentation. Propionic acid production by Propionibacterium acidipropionici immobilized on D printed nylon beads was chosen as a model study. It was shown that those D printed beads were capable of promoting high density cell attachment and propionic acid production which could be adapted to other fermentation bioprocesses. In academic journals had begun to report on the possible artistic applications of D printing technology. As of domestic D printing was reaching a consumer audience beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts. Off the shelf machines were increasingly capable of producing practical household applications for example ornamental objects. Some practical examples include a working clock and gears printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes. Web sites associated with home D printing tended to include backscratchers coat hooks door knobs etc. D printing and open source D printers in particular are the latest technology making inroads into the classroom. Some authors have claimed that D printers offer an unprecedented revolution in STEM education. The evidence for such claims comes from both the low cost ability for rapid prototyping in the classroom by students but also the fabrication of low cost high quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open source labs. Future applications for D printing might include creating open source scientific equipment. In the last several years D printing has been intensively used by in the cultural heritage field for preservation restoration and dissemination purposes. Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum have started using their D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops. Other museums like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum have gone further and sell through the online platform Threeding digital models of their artifacts created using Artec D scanners in D printing friendly file format which everyone can D print at home. D printed soft actuators is a growing application of D printing technology which has found its place in the D printing applications. These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between human and robot is inevitable. The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices post processing assembly and lengthy iterations until maturity of the fabrication is achieved. Instead of the tedious and time consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Thus D printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionise the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical functional and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints adhesives and fasteners. Circuit board manufacturing involves multiple steps which include imaging drilling plating soldermask coating nomenclature printing and surface finishes. These steps include many chemicals such as harsh solvents and acids. D printing circuit boards remove the need for many of these steps while still producing complex designs. . Polymer ink is used to create the layers of the build while silver polymer is used for creating the traces and holes used to allow electricity to flow. . Current circuit board manufacturing can be a tedious process depending on the design. Specified materials are gathered and sent into inner layer processing where images are printed developed and etched. The etches cores are typically punched to add lamination tooling. The cores are then prepared for lamination. The stack up the build up of a circuit board is built and sent into lamination where the layers are bonded. The boards are then measured and drilled. Many steps may differ from this stage however for simple designs the material goes through a plating process to plate the holes and surface. The outer image is then printed developed and etched. After the image is defined the material must get coated with soldermask for later soldering. Nomenclature is then added so components can be identified later. Then the surface finish is added. The boards are routed out of panel form into their singular or array form and then electrically tested. Aside from the paperwork which must be completed which proves the boards meet specifications the boards are then packed and shipped. The benefits of D printing would be that the final outline is defined from the beginning no imaging punching or lamination is required and electrical connections are made with the silver polymer which eliminates drilling and plating. The final paperwork would also be greatly reduced due to the lack of materials required to build the circuit board. Complex designs which may takes weeks to complete through normal processing can be D printed greatly reducing manufacturing time. D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes including patents industrial design rights copyrights and trademarks may apply. However there is not much jurisprudence to say how these laws will apply if D printers become mainstream and individuals or hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use for non profit distribution or for sale. Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in D printing or the distribution or sale of the printed item. To be allowed to do these things where an active intellectual property was involved a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence which may come with conditions and a price. However many patent design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for private non commercial use of inventions designs or works of art protected under intellectual property IP . That standard limitation or exception may leave such private non commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights. Patents cover inventions including processes machines manufacturing and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries but generally years from the date of application. Therefore if a type of wheel is patented printing using or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent. Copyright covers an expression in a tangible fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus years thereafter. If someone makes a statue they may have a copyright mark on the appearance of that statue so if someone sees that statue they cannot then distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue. When a feature has both artistic copyrightable and functional patentable merits when the question has appeared in US court the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing for example the design of a useful device to be registered as a whole as an industrial design on the understanding that in case of unauthorized copying only the non functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent. The US Department of Homeland Security and the Joint Regional Intelligence Center released a memo stating that significant advances in three dimensional D printing capabilities availability of free digital D printable files for firearms components and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture D printed guns and that proposed legislation to ban D printing of weapons may deter but cannot completely prevent their production. Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation online distribution of these D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music movie or software files. Attempting to restrict the distribution of gun plans via the Internet has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of DeCSS which enabled DVD ripping. After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans they were still widely available via the Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites. Downloads of the plans from the UK Germany Spain and Brazil were heavy. Some US legislators have proposed regulations on D printers to prevent them from being used for printing guns. D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile could cripple the D printing industry and could infringe on free speech rights with early pioneer of D printing Professor Hod Lipson suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead. Internationally where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt since alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable. Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a D printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws. Europol stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as technology improves the risks of an effect would increase. In the United States the FAA has anticipated a desire to use additive manufacturing techniques and has been considering how best to regulate this process. The FAA has jurisdiction over such fabrication because all aircraft parts must be made under FAA production approval or under other FAA regulatory categories. In December the FAA approved the production of a D printed fuel nozzle for the GE LEAP engine. Aviation attorney Jason Dickstein has suggested that additive manufacturing is merely a production method and should be regulated like any other production method. He has suggested that the FAA s focus should be on guidance to explain compliance rather than on changing the existing rules and that existing regulations and guidance permit a company to develop a robust quality system that adequately reflects regulatory needs for quality assurance. Research on the health and safety concerns of D printing is new and in development due to the recent proliferation of D printing devices. In the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has published a discussion paper on the processes and materials involved in D printing potential implications of this technology for occupational safety and health and avenues for controlling potential hazards. Emissions from fused filament printers can include a large number of ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds VOCs . The toxicity from emissions varies by source material due to differences in size chemical properties and quantity of emitted particles. Excessive exposure to VOCs can lead to irritation of the eyes nose and throat headache loss of coordination and nausea and some of the chemical emissions of fused filament printers have also been linked to asthma. Based on animal studies carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers sometimes used in fused filament printing can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation granulomas and pulmonary fibrosis when at the nanoparticle size. A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH study noted particle emissions from a fused filament peaked a few minutes after printing started and returned to baseline levels minutes after printing ended. Workers may also inadvertently transport materials outside the workplace on their shoes garments and body which may pose hazards for other members of the public. Carbon nanoparticle emissions and processes using powder metals are highly combustible and raise the risk of dust explosions. At least one case of severe injury was noted from an explosion involved in metal powders used for fused filament printing. Additional hazards include burns from hot surfaces such as lamps and print head blocks exposure to laser or ultraviolet radiation electrical shock mechanical injury from being struck by moving parts and noise and ergonomic hazards. Other concerns involve gas and material exposures in particular nanomaterials material handling static electricity moving parts and pressures. Hazards to health and safety also exist from post processing activities done to finish parts after they have been printed. These post processing activities can include chemical baths sanding polishing or vapor exposure to refine surface finish as well as general subtractive manufacturing techniques such as drilling milling or turning to modify the printed geometry. Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used such as respirators or safety glasses. Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes. These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin. Since D imaging creates items by fusing materials together there runs the risk of layer separation in some devices made using D Imaging. For example in January the US medical device company DePuy recalled their knee and hip replacement systems. The devices were made from layers of metal and shavings had come loose potentially harming the patient. Hazard controls include using manufacturer supplied covers and full enclosures using proper ventilation keeping workers away from the printer using respirators turning off the printer if it jammed and using lower emission printers and filaments. Personal protective equipment has been found to be the least desirable control method with a recommendation that it only be used to add further protection in combination with approved emissions protection. Although no occupational exposure limits specific to D printer emissions exist certain source materials used in D printing such as carbon nanofiber and carbon nanotubes have established occupational exposure limits at the nanoparticle size. As of March update the US Government has set D printer emission standards for only a limited number of compounds. Furthermore the few established standards address factory conditions not home or other environments in which the printers are likely to be used. Additive manufacturing starting with today s infancy period requires manufacturing firms to be flexible ever improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations. The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production however is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely. The futurologist Jeremy Rifkin claimed that D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late th century. Since the s a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology. In recent years D printing is creating significant impact in the humanitarian and development sector. Its potential to facilitate distributed manufacturing is resulting in supply chain and logistics benefits by reducing the need for transportation warehousing and wastage. Furthermore social and economic development is being advanced through the creation of local production economies. Others have suggested that as more and more D printers start to enter people s homes the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise it has also been suggested that as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe so the need for high speed freight services might also become less. Finally given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available. As D printers became more accessible to consumers online social platforms have developed to support the community. This includes websites that allow users to access information such as how to build a D printer as well as social forums that discuss how to improve D print quality and discuss D printing news as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share D models. RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on d printing and has developed into a community that aims to bring D printing to everyone. Furthermore there are other sites such as Pinshape Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory which were created initially to allow users to post D files for anyone to print allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing D files. These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users creating communities dedicated to D printing. Some call attention to the conjunction of Commons based peer production with D printing and other low cost manufacturing techniques. The self reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope and here society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity. Further it is true that many issues problems and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned weapons manufacturing could become easier not to mention the implications for counterfeiting and on intellectual property. It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale Commons based peer production D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation the economies of scope share infrastructure costs intangible and tangible productive resources taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies Commons based peer production and D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs. Larry Summers wrote about the devastating consequences of D printing and other technologies robots artificial intelligence etc. for those who perform routine tasks. In his view already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction particularly for the less skilled as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white collar as well as blue collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead. Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the myriad devices e.g. tax havens bank secrecy money laundering and regulatory arbitrage enabling the holders of great wealth to a paying income and estate taxes and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring great social contributions in return including more vigorous enforcement of anti monopoly laws reductions in excessive protection for intellectual property greater encouragement of profit sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements improvements in corporate governance strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity easing of land use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development e.g. in energy production and transportation. Michael Spence wrote that Now comes a ... powerful wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors think of ATMs online banking enterprise resource planning customer relationship management mobile payment systems and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods where robots and D printing are displacing labor. In his view the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start in the design of hardware e.g. D printers and more important in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. Once this is achieved the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low and declines as scale rises and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing the incentives to invest in digital technologies are compelling. Spence believes that unlike prior digital technologies which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies is cost reduction via the replacement of labor. For example as the cost of D printing technology declines it is easy to imagine that production may become extremely local and customized. Moreover production may occur in response to actual demand not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor no matter how inexpensive will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion with labor intensive process oriented manufacturing becoming less effective and that re localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view production will not disappear but it will be less labor intensive and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital not goods services and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets policies investments especially in human capital and quite possibly models of employment and distribution. Naomi Wu regards the usage of D printing in the Chinese classroom where rote memorization is standard to teach design principles and creativity as the most exciting recent development of the technology and more generally regards D printing as being the next desktop publishing revolution. The growth of additive manufacturing could have a large impact on the environment. As opposed to traditional manufacturing for instance in which pieces are cut from larger blocks of material additive manufacturing creates products layer by layer and prints only relevant parts wasting much less material and thus wasting less energy in producing the raw materials needed. By making only the bare structural necessities of products additive manufacturing also could make a profound contribution to lightweighting reducing the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and other forms of transportation. A case study on an airplane component made using additive manufacturing for example found that the component s use saves of relevant energy and carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the product s lifetime. In addition previous life cycle assessment of additive manufacturing has estimated that adopting the technology could further lower carbon dioxide emissions since D printing creates localized production and products would not need to be transported long distances to reach their final destination. Continuing to adopt additive manufacturing does pose some environmental downsides however. Despite additive manufacturing reducing waste from the subtractive manufacturing process by up to the additive manufacturing process creates other forms of waste such as non recyclable material powders. Additive manufacturing has not yet reached its theoretical material efficiency potential of but it may get closer as the technology continues to increase productivity.  ",FALSE
"47",47,"biofuel","/wiki/Biofuel",TRUE,0,"process|","A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels such as oil"," A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels such as oil. Since biomass technically can be used as a fuel directly e.g. wood logs some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. More often than not however the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of or some form of thermally chemically altered solid end product like torrefied pellets or briquettes. The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels used for transportation. The EIA U.S. Energy Information Administration follow this naming practice. If the biomass used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly the fuel is generally considered to be a form of renewable energy. Biofuels can be produced from plants i.e. energy crops or from agricultural commercial domestic and or industrial wastes if the waste has a biological origin . Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Some argue that biofuel can be carbon neutral because all biomass crops sequester carbon to a certain extent basically all crops move CO from above ground circulation to below ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil. For instance McCalmont et al. found below ground carbon accumulation ranging from . to . tonnes per hectare per year for soils below Miscanthus x giganteus energy crops with a mean accumulation rate of . tonne . tonnes per acre per year or of total harvested carbon per year. However the simple proposal that biofuel is carbon neutral almost by definition has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral the total carbon sequestered by the energy crop s root system must compensate for all the above ground emissions related to this particular biofuel project . This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect land use change. Many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives. Some are carbon neutral or even negative though especially perennial crops. The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG greenhouse gases emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive neutral or negative. A carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the total life cycle GHG emissions above ground. In other words to achieve carbon neutrality yields should be high and emissions should be low. High yielding energy crops are thus prime candidates for carbon neutrality. The graphic on the right displays two CO negative Miscanthus x giganteus production pathways represented in gram CO equivalents per megajoule. The yellow diamonds represent mean values. Further successful sequestration is dependent on planting sites as the best soils for sequestration are those that are currently low in carbon. The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact. For the UK successful sequestration is expected for arable land over most of England and Wales with unsuccessful sequestration expected in parts of Scotland due to already carbon rich soils existing woodland plus lower yields. Soils already rich in carbon includes peatland and mature forest. Grassland can also be carbon rich however Milner et al. argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands. The bottom graphic displays the estimated yield necessary to compensate for related lifecycle GHG emissions. The higher the yield the more likely CO negativity becomes. The two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel. Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or sweet sorghum. Cellulosic biomass derived from non food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form E but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form B but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from diesel powered vehicles. In worldwide biofuel production reached billion liters billion gallons US up from and biofuels provided of the world s fuels for road transport. The International Energy Agency want biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by in order to reduce dependency on petroleum. However the production and consumption of biofuels are not on track to meet the IEA s sustainable development scenario. From to global biofuel output has to increase by each year to reach IEA s goal. Only growth annually is expected. There are various social economic environmental and technical issues relating to biofuels production and use which have been debated in the popular media and scientific journals. First generation or conventional biofuels are biofuels made from food crops grown on arable land. With this biofuel production generation food crops are thus explicitly grown for fuel production and not anything else. The sugar starch or vegetable oil obtained from the crops is converted into biodiesel or ethanol using transesterification or yeast fermentation. Second generation biofuels are fuels manufactured from various types of biomass. Biomass is a wide ranging term meaning any source of organic carbon that is renewed rapidly as part of the carbon cycle. Biomass is derived from plant materials but can also include animal materials. Whereas first generation biofuels are made from the sugars and vegetable oils found in arable crops second generation biofuels are made from lignocellulosic biomass or woody crops agricultural residues or waste plant material from food crops that have already fulfilled their food purpose . The feedstock used to generate second generation biofuels thus either grows on arable lands but are just byproducts of the actual harvest main crop or they are grown on lands which cannot be used to effectively grow food crops and in some cases neither extra water or fertilizer is applied to them. Non human food second generation feedstock sources include grasses jatropha and other seed crops waste vegetable oil municipal solid waste and so forth. This has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that unlike with regular food crops no arable land is used solely for the production of fuel. The disadvantage is that unlike with regular food crops it may be rather difficult to extract the fuel. For instance a series of physical and chemical treatments might be required to convert lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuels suitable for transportation. From to the US NREL experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the Aquatic Species Program. A self published article by Michael Briggs at the UNH Biofuels Group offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all vehicular fuel with biofuels by using algae that have a natural oil content greater than which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants. This oil rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol. The production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield algaculture unlike crop based biofuels does not entail a decrease in food production since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bioreactors for various purposes including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels. Prof. Rodrigo E. Teixeira from the University of Alabama in Huntsville demonstrated the extraction of biofuels lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in ionic liquids. Similarly to third generation biofuels fourth generation biofuels are made using non arable land. However unlike third generation biofuels they do not require the destruction of biomass. This class of biofuels includes electrofuels and photobiological solar fuels. Some of these fuels are carbon neutral. The following fuels can be produced using first second third or fourth generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can even be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures. Biogas is methane produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes. It can be produced either from biodegradable waste materials or by the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct digestate can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer. Biogas can be recovered from mechanical biological treatment waste processing systems. Landfill gas a less clean form of biogas is produced in landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere it is a potential greenhouse gas. Farmers can produce biogas from manure from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters. Syngas a mixture of carbon monoxide hydrogen and other hydrocarbons is produced by partial combustion of biomass that is combustion with an amount of oxygen that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water. Before partial combustion the biomass is dried and sometimes pyrolysed. The resulting gas mixture syngas is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted. Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines turbines or high temperature fuel cells. The wood gas generator a wood fueled gasification reactor can be connected to an internal combustion engine. Syngas can be used to produce methanol DME and hydrogen or converted via the Fischer Tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than C. Lower temperature gasification is desirable when co producing biochar but results in syngas polluted with tar. Biologically produced alcohols most commonly ethanol and less commonly propanol and butanol are produced by the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches easiest or cellulose which is more difficult . Biobutanol also called biogasoline is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine. Ethanol fuel is the most common biofuel worldwide particularly in Brazil. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat corn sugar beets sugar cane molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey can be made such as potato and fruit waste etc. . The ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion to release sugars from stored starches fermentation of the sugars distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel but cellulosic biomass such as bagasse the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice is the most common fuel in Brazil while pellets wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe Waste steam fuels ethanol factory where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid. Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to bioethanol with petroleum gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller energy density than that of gasoline this means it takes more fuel volume and mass to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol CHCHOH is that it has a higher octane rating than ethanol free gasoline available at roadside gas stations which allows an increase of an engine s compression ratio for increased thermal efficiency. In high altitude thin air locations some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter oxidizer to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions. Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol fireplaces. As they do not require a chimney and are flueless bioethanol fires are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue. The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Corn to ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of cellulosic ethanol. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy the fossil energy ratios FER for cellulosic ethanol corn ethanol and gasoline are . . and . respectively. Ethanol has roughly one third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol in a long term test of more than . million km the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be more energy efficient than petrol cars but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately so more fuel stops are required . With current subsidies ethanol fuel is slightly cheaper per distance traveled in the United States. citation needed Methanol is currently produced from natural gas a non renewable fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as biomethanol. This is technically feasible but the production is currently being postponed for concerns that the economic viability is still pending. The methanol economy is an alternative to the hydrogen economy compared to today s hydrogen production from natural gas. Butanol CHOH is formed by ABE fermentation acetone butanol ethanol and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high net energy gains with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy and allegedly can be burned straight in existing gasoline engines without modification to the engine or car and is less corrosive and less water soluble than ethanol and could be distributed via existing infrastructures. DuPont and BP are working together to help develop butanol. Escherichia coli strains have also been successfully engineered to produce butanol by modifying their amino acid metabolism. One drawback to butanol production in E. coli remains the high cost of nutrient rich media however recent work has demonstrated E. coli can produce butanol with minimal nutritional supplementation. Biodiesel is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil mineral diesel. Chemically it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters FAMEs . Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats vegetable oils soy rapeseed jatropha mahua mustard flax sunflower palm oil hemp field pennycress Pongamia pinnata and algae. Pure biodiesel B also known as neat biodiesel currently reduces emissions with up to compared to diesel Second generation B. Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form B in diesel engines but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization since the fuel becomes somewhat more viscous at lower temperatures depending on the feedstock used. In some countries manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B use although Volkswagen of Germany for example asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B. In most cases biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from onwards which use Viton by DuPont synthetic rubber in their mechanical fuel injection systems. Note however that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date. Electronically controlled common rail and unit injector type systems from the late s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B without altering the engine itself although this depends on the fuel rail design. Since biodiesel is an effective solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel engine filters may need to be replaced more often as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries a biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However using pure biodiesel may increase NOx emissions Biodiesel is also safe to handle and transport because it is non toxic and biodegradable and has a high flash point of about F C compared to petroleum diesel fuel which has a flash point of F C . In the US more than of commercial trucks and city buses run on diesel. The emerging US biodiesel market is estimated to have grown from to . By the end of biodiesel production was estimated to increase fourfold from to more than billion US gallons m . In France biodiesel is incorporated at a rate of in the fuel used by all French diesel vehicles. Avril Group produces under the brand Diester a fifth of million tons of biodiesel consumed annually by the European Union. It is the leading European producer of biodiesel. Green diesel is produced through hydrocracking biological oil feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Hydrocracking is a refinery method that uses elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules such as those found in vegetable oils into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. It may also be called renewable diesel hydrotreated vegetable oil or hydrogen derived renewable diesel. Unlike biodiesel green diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum based diesel. It does not require new engines pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. Gasoline versions are also being developed. Green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips Neste Oil Valero Dynamic Fuels and Honeywell UOP as well as Preem in Gothenburg Sweden creating what is known as Evolution Diesel. Straight unmodified edible vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel but lower quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel or more rarely cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel. As with biodiesel B to ensure the fuel injectors atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion vegetable oil fuel must be heated to reduce its viscosity to that of diesel either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. MAN B W Diesel Wrtsil and Deutz AG as well as a number of smaller companies such as Elsbett offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil without the need for after market modifications. Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use common rail or unit injection electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in indirect injection engines these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines especially Mercedes are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre Pumpe Duse VW TDI engines and other similar engines with direct injection. Several companies such as Elsbett or Wolf have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades. Oils and fats can be hydrogenated to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight chain hydrocarbon with a high cetane number low in aromatics and sulfur and does not contain oxygen. Hydrogenated oils can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel including good performance at low temperatures no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack. Bioethers also referred to as fuel ethers or oxygenated fuels are cost effective compounds that act as octane rating enhancers. Bioethers are produced by the reaction of reactive iso olefins such as iso butylene with bioethanol. Bioethers are created from wheat or sugar beets. They also enhance engine performance while significantly reducing engine wear and toxic exhaust emissions. Although bioethers are likely to replace petroethers in the UK it is highly unlikely they will become a fuel in and of itself due to the low energy density. By greatly reducing the amount of ground level ozone emissions they contribute to air quality. When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives dimethyl ether DME diethyl ether DEE methyl tert butyl ether MTBE ethyl tert butyl ether ETBE tert amyl methyl ether TAME and tert amyl ethyl ether TAEE . The European Fuel Oxygenates Association EFOA identifies methyl tert butyl ether MTBE and ethyl tert butyl ether ETBE as the most commonly used ethers in fuel to replace lead. Ethers were introduced in Europe in the s to replace the highly toxic compound. Although Europeans still use bioether additives the US no longer has an oxygenate requirement therefore bioethers are no longer used as the main fuel additive.  So called drop in biofuels can be defined as liquid bio hydrocarbons that are functionally equivalent to petroleum fuels and are fully compatible with existing petroleum infrastructure . Drop in biofuels require no engine modification of the vehicle. Some examples of drop in biofuels include biobutanol biodiesel synthetic paraffinic kerosine and other synthetic fuels. According to a July report published by the IEA Bioenergy Task entitled The Potential and Challenges of Drop in Biofuels there are several ways to produce drop in biofuels that are functionally equivalent to petroleum derived transportation fuel blendstocks. These are discussed within three major sections of the full report and include A fourth category is also briefly described that includes hybrid thermochemical biochemical technologies such as fermentation of synthesis gas and catalytic reforming of sugars carbohydrates. The report concludes by stating Tremendous entrepreneurial activity to develop and commercialize drop in biofuels from aquatic and terrestrial feedstocks has taken place over the past several years. However despite these efforts drop in biofuels represent only a small percentage around of global biofuel markets. ... Due to the increased processing and resource requirements e.g. hydrogen and catalysts needed to make drop in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels large scale production of cost competitive drop in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm. Rather dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production. Currently no policies e.g. tax breaks subsidies etc. differentiate new more fungible and infrastructure ready drop in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels. ... Thus while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop in fuels supportive policies directed specifically towards the further development of drop in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success. There are international organizations such as IEA Bioenergy established in by the OECD International Energy Agency IEA with the aim of improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programs in bioenergy research development and deployment. The UN International Biofuels Forum is formed by Brazil China India Pakistan South Africa the United States and the European Commission. The world leaders in biofuel development and use are Brazil the United States France Sweden and Germany. Russia also has of world s forest and is a big biomass solid biofuels supplier. In Russian pulp and paper maker Vyborgskaya Cellulose said they would be producing pellets that can be used in heat and electricity generation from its plant in Vyborg by the end of the year. The plant will eventually produce about tons of pellets per year making it the largest in the world once operational. Biofuels currently make up . of the total road transport fuel in the UK or million litres. By of the energy used in UK road and rail transport must come from renewable sources this is the equivalent of replacing . million tonnes of fossil oil each year. Conventional biofuels are likely to produce between . and . of the energy needed in road and rail transport while advanced biofuels could meet up to . of the UK s renewable transport fuel target by . Biofuels are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution. Burning produces carbon dioxide airborne carbon particulates carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides. The WHO estimates . million premature deaths worldwide in due to air pollution. Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas chromatograph studies were performed of ambient air in So Paulo Brazil and compared to Osaka Japan which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was higher in Brazil and Acetaldehyde was higher. The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged in April that the increased use of bioethanol will lead to worse air quality. The total emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides will rise due the growing use of bioethanol. There is an increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels to produce the biofuels as well as nitrous oxide from the soil which has most likely been treated with nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrous oxide is known to have a greater impact on the atmosphere in relation to global warming as it is also an ozone destroyer. There are various social economic environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include the effect of moderating oil prices the food vs fuel debate food prices poverty reduction potential energy ratio energy requirements carbon emissions levels sustainable biofuel production deforestation and soil erosion loss of biodiversity impact on water resources the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel as well as energy balance and efficiency. The International Resource Panel which provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of resource related themes assessed the issues relating to biofuel use in its first report Towards sustainable production and use of resources Assessing Biofuels. Assessing Biofuels outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another. It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their impact on climate energy security and ecosystems and suggested that environmental and social impacts need to be assessed throughout the entire life cycle. Another issue with biofuel use and production is the US has changed mandates many times because the production has been taking longer than expected. The Renewable Fuel Standard RFS set by congress for was pushed back to at best to produce million gallons of pure ethanol not blended with a fossil fuel . In the EU the revised renewable energy directive calls for a complete ban on first generation biofuels by . Particularly fuels made from such oils such as palm oil and soy oil are being targeted. Many of the biofuels that were being supplied in using the first generation biofuel production procedure have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use. In the Nobel prize winning chemist Paul J. Crutzen published findings that the release of nitrous oxide NO emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace. In the challenge was to support biofuel development including the development of new cellulosic technologies with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represented an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa Latin America and Asia. Biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials have entered the market driven by the perception that they reduce climate gas emissions and also by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production nor cause water or environmental problems and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimisation of biofuel competition for prime cropland. Some scientists have expressed concerns about land use change in response to greater demand for crops to use for biofuel and the subsequent carbon emissions. The payback period that is the time it will take biofuels to pay back the carbon debt they acquire due to land use change has been estimated to be between and years depending on the specific instance and location of land use change. However no till practices combined with cover crop practices can reduce the payback period to three years for grassland conversion and years for forest conversion. A study conducted in the Tocantis State in northern Brazil found that many families were cutting down forests in order to produce two conglomerates of oilseed plants the J. curcas JC group and the R. communis RC group . This region is composed of Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity and Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study the farmers that planted the JC group released over Mg CO while losing Mg CO sequestration from deforestation and the RC group farmers released Mg CO while losing Mg CO to be sequestered from forest depletion. The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. This has to do with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation as well as of fertilizers herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff but also to the emission of nitrous oxide NO as a fertilizer byproduct which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide CO . Converting rainforests peatlands savannas or grasslands to produce food crop based biofuels in Brazil Southeast Asia and the United States creates a biofuel carbon debt by releasing to times more CO than the annual greenhouse gas GHG reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on abandoned agricultural lands incur little to no carbon debt. In addition to crop growth requiring water biofuel facilities require significant process water. Specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and are very useful in crop rotation with cereals and have the added benefit that the meal left over after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide. The NFESC with Santa Barbara based Biodiesel Industries is working to develop biofuels technologies for the US navy and military one of the largest diesel fuel users in the world. A group of Spanish developers working for a company called Ecofasa announced a new biofuel made from trash. The fuel is created from general urban waste which is treated by bacteria to produce fatty acids which can be used to make biofuels. Before its shutdown Joule Unlimited was attempting to make cheap ethanol and biodiesel from a genetically modified photosynthetic bacterium. As of the Wrigley Institute of Environmental Studies was testing kelp farming near Catalina Island to create biofuel by thermochemical liquefaction. As the primary source of biofuels in North America many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production. The National Corn to Ethanol Research Center NCERC is a research division of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville dedicated solely to ethanol based biofuel research projects. On the federal level the USDA conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the United States. Much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets. A division of the US Department of Energy the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL has also conducted various ethanol research projects mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is the process of building an industry out of methods of turning cellulose containing organic matter into fuel. Companies such as Iogen POET and Abengoa are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into bioethanol. Companies such as Diversa Novozymes and Dyadic are producing enzymes that could enable a cellulosic ethanol future. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors. As of the first commercial scale plants to produce cellulosic biofuels have begun operating. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different biofuel feedstocks are being used. In the next few years the cost data of these technologies operating at commercial scale and their relative performance will become available. Lessons learnt will lower the costs of the industrial processes involved. In parts of Asia and Africa where drylands prevail sweet sorghum is being investigated as a potential source of food feed and fuel combined. The crop is particularly suitable for growing in arid conditions as it only extracts one seventh of the water used by sugarcane. In India and other places sweet sorghum stalks are used to produce biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting into ethanol. A study by researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics ICRISAT found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could increase farmers incomes by US per hectare per crop because it can provide fuel in addition to food and animal feed. With grain sorghum currently grown on over million hectares ha in Asia and on . million ha in Africa a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact. Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha curcas a poisonous shrub like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil. Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha through advancements in genetics soil science and horticultural practices. SG Biofuels a San Diego based jatropha developer has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties. SG Biofuels also claims additional benefits have arisen from such strains including improved flowering synchronicity higher resistance to pests and diseases and increased cold weather tolerance. Plant Research International a department of the Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project that examines the feasibility of large scale jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments. The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming CfSEF is a Los Angeles based nonprofit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science agronomy and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by in the next years. A group at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow in a paper stated they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single celled fungi and turned it into biofuels in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species Cunninghamella japonica and others is likely to appear in the near future. The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus Gliocladium roseum later renamed Ascocoryne sarcoides points toward the production of so called myco diesel from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern Patagonia and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel. Many other fungi that can degrade cellulose and other polymers have been observed to produce molecules that are currently being engineered using organisms from other kingdoms suggesting that fungi may play a large role in the bioproduction of fuels in the future. Microbial gastrointestinal flora in a variety of animals have shown potential for the production of biofuels. Recent research has shown that TU a strain of Clostridium bacteria found in Zebra feces can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel. Microbes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials. There has also been substantial research into the technology of using the gut microbiomes of wood feeding insects for the conversion of lignocellulotic material into biofuel.",FALSE

The energy can be in any form in either subsystem but most energy recovery systems exchange thermal energy in either sensible or latent form. In some circumstances the use of an enabling technology either diurnal thermal energy storage or seasonal thermal energy storage STES which allows heat or cold storage between opposing seasons is necessary to make energy recovery practicable. One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is an STES application at a foundry in Sweden. Waste heat is recovered and stored in a large mass of native bedrock which is penetrated by a cluster of heat exchanger equipped boreholes mm diameter that are m deep. This store is used for heating an adjacent factory as needed even months later. An example of using STES to recover and utilize natural heat that otherwise would be wasted is the Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta Canada. The community uses a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage and this enables obtaining percent of the year round space heating from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs. Another STES application is recovering the cold of winter by circulating water through a dry cooling tower and using that to chill a deep aquifer or borehole cluster. The chill is later recovered from the storage for summer air conditioning. With a coefficient of performance COP of to this method of cooling can be ten times more efficient than conventional air conditioning. A common application of this principle is in systems which have an exhaust stream or waste stream which is transferred from the system to its surroundings. Some of the energy in that flow of material often gaseous or liquid may be transferred to the make up or input material flow. This input mass flow often comes from the system s surroundings which being at ambient conditions are at a lower temperature than the waste stream. This temperature differential allows heat transfer and thus energy transfer or in this case recovery. Thermal energy is often recovered from liquid or gaseous waste streams to fresh make up air and water intakes in buildings such as for the HVAC systems or process systems. Energy consumption is a key part of most human activities. This consumption involves converting one energy system to another for example The conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy which can then power computers light motors etc. The input energy propels the work and is mostly converted to heat or follows the product in the process as output energy. Energy recovery systems harvest the output power and provide this as input power to the same or another process. An energy recovery system will close this energy cycle to prevent the input power from being released back to nature and rather be used in other forms of desired work. Electric Turbo Compounding ETC is a technology solution to the challenge of improving the fuel efficiency of gas and diesel engines by recovering waste energy from the exhaust gases. There is a large potential for energy recovery in compact systems like large industries and utilities. Together with energy conservation it should be possible to dramatically reduce world energy consumption. The effect of this will then be In Tom Casten chairman of Recycled Energy Development said that We think we could make about to percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry. A Department of Energy study found the potential for megawatts of combined heat and power which uses energy recovery in the U.S. and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy not counting CHP. These studies suggest that about megawatts or of total power capacity could come from energy recycling in the U.S. Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated percent. Indeed as of about of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and from the production of heat. It is however difficult to quantify the environmental impact of a global energy recovery implementation in some sectors. The main impediments are citation needed",FALSE

GHG emissions due to anthropogenic human activity are the dominant cause of observed global warming climate change since the mid th century. Continued emission of greenhouse gases may cause long lasting changes around the world increasing the likelihood of severe pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Shifting to low carbon economy on a global scale could bring substantial benefits both for developed and developing countries. Many countries around the world are designing and implementing low emission development strategies LEDS . These strategies seek to achieve social economic and environmental development goals while reducing long term greenhouse gas emissions and increasing resilience to climate change impacts. Globally implemented low carbon economies are therefore proposed by those having drawn this conclusion as a means to avoid catastrophic climate change and as a precursor to the more advanced zero carbon economy. Nations may seek to become low carbon or decarbonised economies as a part of a national climate change mitigation strategy. A comprehensive strategy to mitigate climate change is through carbon neutrality. The aim of an LCE is to integrate all aspects of itself from its manufacturing agriculture transportation and power generation etc. around technologies that produce energy and materials with little GHG emission and thus around populations buildings machines and devices that use those energies and materials efficiently and dispose of or recycle its wastes so as to have a minimal output of GHGs. Furthermore it has been proposed that to make the transition to an LCE economically viable we would have to attribute a cost per unit output to GHGs through means such as emissions trading and or a carbon tax. Some nations are presently low carbon societies that are not heavily industrialized or populated. In order to avoid climate change on a global level all nations considered carbon intensive societies and societies that are heavily populated might have to become zero carbon societies and economies. Several of these countries citation needed have pledged to cut their emissions by via offsetting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions carbon neutrality in other words emitting will not cease but will continue and will be offset to a different geographical area. EU emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low carbon developments. Low carbon economies present multiple benefits to ecosystem resilience trade employment health energy security and industrial competitiveness. Low emission development strategies for the land use sector can prioritize the protection of carbon rich ecosystems to not only reduce emissions but also to protect biodiversity and safeguard local livelihoods to reduce rural poverty all of which can lead to more climate resilient systems according to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP . REDD and blue carbon initiatives are among the measures available to conserve sustainably manage and restore these carbon rich ecosystems which are crucial for natural carbon storage and sequestration and for building climate resilient communities. Transitioning to a low carbon environmentally and socially sustainable economies can become a strong driver of job creation job upgrading social justice and poverty eradication if properly managed with the full engagement of governments workers and employers organizations. Estimates from the International Labour Organization s Global Economic Linkages model suggest that unmitigated climate change with associated negative impacts on enterprises and workers will have negative effects on output in many industries with drops in output of . by and . by . Transitioning to a low carbon economy will cause shifts in the volume composition and quality of employment across sectors and will affect the level and distribution of income. Research indicates that eight sectors employing around . billion workers approximately half the global workforce will undergo major changes agriculture forestry fishing energy resource intensive manufacturing recycling buildings and transport. Low emission industrial development and resource efficiency can offer many opportunities to increase the competitiveness of economies and companies. According to the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP there is often a clear business case for switching to lower emission technologies with payback periods ranging largely from . years leveraging financial investment. Trade and trade policies can contribute to low carbon economies by enabling more efficient use of resources and international exchange of climate friendly goods and services. Removing tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade in clean energy and energy efficiency technologies are one such measure. In a sector where finished products consist of many components that cross borders numerous times a typical wind turbine for example contains up to components even small tariff cuts would reduce costs. This would make the technologies more affordable and competitive in the global market particularly when combined with a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. Recent advances in technology and policy will allow renewable energy and energy efficiency to play major roles in displacing fossil fuels meeting global energy demand while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy technologies are being rapidly commercialized and in conjunction with efficiency gains can achieve far greater emissions reductions than either could independently. Renewable energy is energy that comes from natural resources such as sunlight wind rain tides and geothermal heat which are renewable naturally replenished . In about of global final energy consumption came from renewables. During the five years from the end of through worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of percent annually for many technologies. For wind power and many other renewable technologies growth accelerated in relative to the previous four years. More wind power capacity was added during than any other renewable technology. However grid connected photovoltaics increased the fastest of all renewables technologies with a percent annual average growth rate for the five year period. Energy for power heat cooling and mobility is the key ingredient for development and growth with energy security a prerequisite economic growth making it arguably the most important driver for energy policy. Scaling up renewable energy as part of a low emission development strategy can diversify a country s energy mixes and reduces dependence on imports. In the process of decarbonizing heat and transport through electrification potential changes to electricity peak demand need to be anticipated whilst switching to alternative technologies such as heat pumps for electric vehicles. Installing local renewable capacities can also lower geopolitical risks and exposure to fuel price volatility and improve the balance of trade for importing countries noting that only a handful of countries export oil and gas . Renewable energy offers lower financial and economic risk for businesses through a more stable and predictable cost base for energy supply. Energy efficiency gains in recent decades have been significant but there is still much more that can be achieved. With a concerted effort and strong policies in place future energy efficiency improvements are likely to be very large. Heat is one of many forms of energy wastage that could be captured to significantly increase useful energy without burning more fossil fuels. Biofuels in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials are entering the market driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security. However many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment food security and land use. The challenge is to support biofuel development including the development of new cellulosic technologies with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa Latin America and Asia. Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a silver bullet to deal with transport emissions. However they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy. Nuclear power has been offered as the primary means to achieve a LCE. In terms of large industrialized nations mainland France due primarily to of its electricity being produced by nuclear power has the lowest carbon dioxide production per unit of GDP in the world and it is the largest exporter of electricity in the world earning it approximately billion annually in sales. Concern is often expressed with the matter of spent nuclear fuel storage and security although the physical issues are not large the political difficulties are significant. The liquid fluoride thorium reactor LFTR has been suggested as a solution to the concerns posed by conventional nuclear. France reprocesses their spent nuclear fuel at the La Hague site since and has also treated spent nuclear fuel from France Japan Germany Belgium Switzerland Italy Spain and the Netherlands. One proposal from Karlsruhe University developed as a virtual power station is the use of solar and wind energy for base load with hydro and biogas for make up or peak load. Hydro and biogas are used as grid energy storage. This requires the development of a smart intelligent grid hopefully including local power networks than use energy near the site of production thereby reducing the existing grid loss. A further development of this is the use of the carbon capture hydrogen and its conversion into methane SNG synthetic natural gas to act as a storage for intermittent renewables. CO H CH HO Sabatier reaction This involves the use of the existing natural gas methane grid as the store. In this case the carbon dioxide is given economic value as a component of an energy carrier. This solar fuel cycle uses the excess electrical renewable energy that cannot be used instantaneously in the grid which otherwise would be wasted to create hydrogen via electrolysis of water. The hydrogen is then combined with CO to create synthetic or substitute natural gas SNG and stored in the natural gas network. The natural gas is used to create electrical energy and the heat used as well in CHP on demand when there is not enough sun photovoltaic CSP... or wind turbines or water hydro ocean current waves ... . The German natural gas grid for example has two months of storage more than enough to outlast renewable energy low production points. The concentration of CO in the upper layer of the world s oceans is higher than is found in air and thus it is the most concentrated mine from which zero net carbon fuels can be produced. The U.S. Navy estimates that a typical nuclear propelled aircraft carrier which generates megawatts of electricity can produce US gallons litres of jet fuel per day and production from the onboard nuclear reactor would cost about per gallon . per liter . While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about per gallon shipboard production is already much less expensive. Heather Willauer of the United States Naval Research Laboratory proof tested the technology in fueling an internal combustion engine equipped model airplane with the synthetic fuel. The proposed strategy of carbon capture and storage CCS continued use of non renewable fossil fuels but without allowing carbon dioxide to reach the atmosphere has also been considered as a means to achieve an LCE either in a primary or supporting role. Major concerns include the uncertainty of costs and time needed to successfully implement CCS worldwide and with guarantees that stored emissions will not leak into the biosphere. Combined Heat and Power CHP is a technology which by allowing the more efficient use of fuel will at least reduce carbon emissions should the fuel be biomass or biogas or hydrogen used as an energy store then in principle it can be a zero carbon option. CHP can also be used with a nuclear reactor as the energy source there are examples of such installations in the far North of the Russian Federation. Most of the agricultural facilities in the developed world are mechanized due to rural electrification. Rural electrification has produced significant productivity gains but it also uses a lot of energy. For this and other reasons such as transport costs in a low carbon society rural areas would need available supplies of renewably produced electricity. citation needed Irrigation can be one of the main components of an agricultural facility s energy consumption. In parts of California it can be up to . In the low carbon economy irrigation equipment will be maintained and continuously updated and farms will use less irrigation water. Different crops require different amounts of energy input. For example glasshouse crops irrigated crops and orchards require a lot of energy to maintain while row crops and field crops do not need as much maintenance. Those glasshouse and irrigated crops that do exist will incorporate the following improvements Glasshouse crops Irrigated arable crops Livestock operations can also use a lot of energy depending on how they are run. Feed lots use animal feed made from corn soybeans and other crops. Energy must be expended to produce these crops process and transport them. Free range animals find their own vegetation to feed on. The farmer may expend energy to take care of that vegetation but not nearly as much as the farmer growing cereal and oil seed crops. Many livestock operations currently use a lot of energy to water their livestock. In the low carbon economy such operations will use more water conservation methods such as rainwater collection water cisterns etc. and they will also pump distribute that water with on site renewable energy sources most likely wind and solar . Due to rural electrification most agricultural facilities in the developed world use a lot of electricity. In a low carbon economy farms will be run and equipped to allow for greater energy efficiency. The dairy industry for example will incorporate the following changes Irrigated Dairy Replacing livestock with plant based alternatives is another way of reducing our carbon emissions. The carbon footprint of livestock is large it provides just of total calories but takes up of farmland. Fishing is quite energy intensive. Improvements such as heat recovery on refrigeration and trawl net technology will be common in the low carbon economy. dead link Protecting forests provides integrated benefits to all ranging from increased food production safeguarded local livelihoods protected biodiversity and ecosystems provided by forests and reduced rural poverty. Adopting low emission strategies for both agricultural and forest production also mitigates some of the effects of climate change. In the low carbon economy forestry operations will be focused on low impact practices and regrowth. Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil based carbon reserves too much. Specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products. Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output. Flaring and venting of natural gas in oil wells is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Its contribution to greenhouse gases has declined by three quarters in absolute terms since a peak in the s of approximately million metric tons year and in accounted for about of one percent of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The World Bank estimates that billion cubic meters of natural gas are flared or vented annually datum an amount equivalent to the combined annual gas consumption of Germany and France or enough to supply the entire world with gas for days. This flaring is highly concentrated countries account for of emissions and twenty for . The top ten leading contributors to world gas flaring in were in declining order Russia Nigeria Iran Iraq Algeria Angola Kazakhstan Libya Saudi Arabia and Venezuela . Retail operations in the low carbon economy will have several new features. One will be high efficiency lighting such as compact fluorescent halogen and eventually LED light sources. Many retail stores will also feature roof top solar panel arrays. These make sense because solar panels produce the most energy during the daytime and during the summer. These are the same times that electricity is the most expensive and also the same times that stores use the most electricity. Sustainable low carbon transport systems are based on minimizing travel and shifting to more environmentally as well as socially and economically sustainable mobility improving transport technologies fuels and institutions. Decarbonisation of urban mobility by means of Sustainable transport has many co benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP low carbon transport can help create jobs improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people s time and household income as well as government budgets making investment in sustainable transport a win win opportunity. There have been some moves to investigate the ways and extent to which health systems contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and how they may need to change to become part of a low carbon world. The Sustainable Development Unit of the NHS in the UK is one of the first official bodies to have been set up in this area whilst organisations such as the Campaign for Greener Healthcare are also producing influential changes at a clinical level. This work includes Some of the suggested changes needed are Low carbon tourism includes travels with low energy consumption and low CO and pollution emissions. Change of personal behavior to more low carbon oriented activities is mostly influenced by both individual awareness and attitudes as well as external social aspect such as culture and environment. Studies indicate that educational level and occupation influence an individual perception of low carbon tourism. A good overview of the history of international efforts towards a low carbon economy from its initial seed at the inaugural UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in has been given by David Runnals. On the international scene the most prominent early step in the direction of a low carbon economy was the signing of the Kyoto Protocol which came into force on February under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions. Importantly all member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development except the United States have ratified the protocol. Europe is the leading geopolitical continent in defining and mobilising decarbonisation policies. For instance the UITP an organisation advocating sustainable mobility and public transport has an EU office but less well developed contacts with for example the US. The European Union Committee of the UITP wants to promote decarbonisation of urban mobility in Europe. Although Europe is nowadays the leading geopolitical continent with regard to lowering emissions Europe is quickly losing ground to Asia with countries such as China and South Korea. However the Global Green Economy Index GGEI ranks nations on their green economic performance finding that the Nordic countries and Switzerland have the best combined performance around climate change and green economy. Australia has implemented schemes to start the transition to a low carbon economy but carbon neutrality has not been mentioned and since the introduction of the schemes emissions have increased. The Second Rudd Government pledged to lower emissions by . In The Howard Government introduced a Mandatory Renewable Energy Target MRET scheme. In the Government revised the MRET percent of Australia s electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by . Renewable energy sources provide of the nation s energy and this figure will increase significantly in the coming years. However coal dependence and exporting conflicts with the concept of Australia as a low carbon economy. Carbon neutral businesses have received no incentive they have voluntarily done so. Carbon offset companies offer assessments based on lifecycle impacts to businesses that seek carbon neutrality. In Australia the only true certified carbon neutral scheme is the Australian government s National Carbon Offset Standard NCOS which includes a mandatory independent audit. Three of the four of Australia s top banks are now certified under this scheme and full list of compliant companies can be seen here http www.environment.gov.au climate change carbon neutral carbon neutral program accredited businesses Certified organisations . Businesses are now moving from unaccredited schemes such as noco and transitioning to NCOS as the only one that is externally audited. Most of leading carbon management companies have also aligned with NCOS such as Net Balance https web.archive.org web http www.netbalance.com Pangolin Associates who themselves are independently certified under NCOS http pangolinassociates.com sustainability services ncos carbon neutrality Energetics http energetics.com.au home and the big four accounting firms. In the Gillard Government introduced a price on carbon dioxide emissions for businesses. Although often characterised as a tax it lacked the revenue raising nature of a true tax. In on the election of the Abbott government immediate legislative steps were taken to repeal the so called carbon tax. The price on carbon was repealed on the th July by an act of parliament. As it stands Australia currently has no mechanism to deal with climate change. In China the city of Dongtan is to be built to produce zero net greenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese State Council announced in it aimed to cut China s carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by in from levels. However carbon dioxide emissions were still increasing by a year by and China was emitting more carbon dioxide than the next two biggest countries combined U.S.A. and India . Total carbon dioxide emissions were projected to increase until . Costa Rica sources much of its energy needs from renewables and is undertaking reforestation projects. In the Costa Rican government announced the commitment for Costa Rica to become the first carbon neutral country by . Iceland began utilising renewable energy early in the th century and so since has been a low carbon economy. However since dramatic economic growth Iceland s emissions have increased significantly per capita. As of Iceland energy is sourced from mostly geothermal energy and hydropower renewable energy in Iceland and since has provided over of the nation s primary energy and . of Iceland s electricity. As a result of this Iceland s carbon emissions per capita are lower than those of the United States despite using more primary energy per capita due to the fact that it is renewable and low cost. Iceland seeks carbon neutrality and expects to use renewable energy by by generating hydrogen fuel from renewable energy sources. Low carbon strategies for inclusive growth An interim report India May The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC estimates that economic losses related to climate change for Peru could reach over of national gross domestic product GDP by . Being a large country with a long coastline snow capped mountains and sizeable forests Peru s varying ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Several mountain glaciers have already begun to retreat leading to water scarcity in some areas. In the period between and Peru experienced a increase in per capita carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production marking one of the largest increases amongst South American countries. Peru brought in a National Strategy on Climate Change in . It is a detailed accounting of strategic focuses that prioritize scientific research mitigation of climate change effects on the poor and creating Clean Development Mechanism CDM mitigation and adaptation policies. In the Peruvian Ministry of Environment published a Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change. The Plan categorises existing and future programmes into seven action groups including reporting mechanisms on GHG emissions mitigation adaptation research and development of technology of systems financing and management and public education. It also contains detailed budget information and analysis relating to climate change. In Peru hosted the Twentieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC COP negotiations. At the same time Peru enacted a new climate law which provides for the creation of a national greenhouse gas inventory system called INFOCARBONO. According to the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership LEDS GP INFOCARBONO is a major transformation of the country s greenhouse gas management system. Previously the system was under the sole control of the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment. The new framework makes each relevant ministry responsible for their own share of greenhouse gas management. In the United Kingdom the Climate Change Act outlining a framework for the transition to a low carbon economy became law on November . This legislation requires an cut in the UK s carbon emissions by compared to levels with an intermediate target of between and by . Thus the UK became the first country to set such a long range and significant carbon reduction target into law. A meeting at the Royal Society on November concluded that an integrated approach making best use of all available technologies is required to move toward a low carbon future. It was suggested by participants that it would be possible to move to a low carbon economy within a few decades but that urgent and sustained action is needed on several fronts . In June the UK coalition government announced the introduction of mandatory carbon reporting requiring around of the UK s largest listed companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions every year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg confirmed that emission reporting rules would come into effect from April in his piece for The Guardian. In July the UK Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme ESOS came into force. This requires all large businesses in the UK to undertake mandatory assessments looking at energy use and energy efficiency opportunities at least once every four years. The low carbon economy has been described as a UK success story accounting for more than billion in annual sales and employing almost million people. A report suggests that over a third of the UK s economic growth in was likely to have come from green business. Companies are planning large scale developments without using fossil fuels. Development plans such as those by World Wide Assets LLC for entire cities using only geothermal energy for electricity geothermal desalination and employing full recycling systems for water and waste are under development in Mexico and Australia. The University of Reading has a Renewable Energy inc. a carbon management module MSc The University of Edinburgh has both an on campus Carbon Management MSc and an online Masters in Carbon Management. As well as a Carbon Finance MSc. The University of East Anglia has a Strategic Carbon Management MBA. The myclimate climate education offers capacity building tools like exhibitions games schoolbooks and courses for young people adults and businesses.

Such resources may include financial resources inventory human skills production resources or information technology IT and natural resources. In the realm of project management processes techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed. These include discussions on functional vs. cross functional resource allocation as well as processes espoused by organizations like the Project Management Institute PMI through their Project Management Body of Knowledge PMBOK methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully. As is the case with the larger discipline of project management there are resource management software tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including supply and demand of resources. The goal of these tools typically is to ensure that i there are employees within our organization with required specific skill set and desired profile required for a project ii decide the number and skill sets of new employees to hire and iii allocate the workforce to various projects. Within professional services and consulting organizations the effectiveness of these tools and processes is typically monitored by measuring billable utilization rate. Large organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over allocated across multiple projects. Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources abandoning a less promising initiatives for every new project taken on as fragmentation inhibits results. One resource management technique is resource leveling. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand reducing both excess inventories and shortages. The required data are the demands for various resources forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable as well as the resources configurations required in those demands and the supply of the resources again forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable. The goal is to achieve utilization but that is very unlikely when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints for example meeting a minimum service level but otherwise minimizing cost. A Project Resource Allocation Matrix PRAM is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects. The principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities then unleash the capabilities as demanded. A dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability. In conservation resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity. Examples of this form of management are air resource management soil conservation forestry wildlife management and water resource management. The broad term for this type of resource management is natural resource management NRM . In addition we can use Ishikawa diagram to analyze Man Money Material and Machine needed. In a nutshell resource management is the process of finding the answers to the question how to use available resources efficiently effectively and economically.",FALSE
"51",51,"sewage sludge","/wiki/Sewage_sludge",TRUE,0,"material|material|waste|product|treatment|","Sewage sludge is the residual semi solid material that is produced as a by product during sewage treatment of industrial or municipal wastewater","Sewage sludge is the residual semi solid material that is produced as a by product during sewage treatment of industrial or municipal wastewater. The term septage also refers to sludge from simple wastewater treatment but is connected to simple on site sanitation systems such as septic tanks. When fresh sewage or wastewater enters a primary settling tank approximately of the suspended solid matter will settle out in an hour and a half. This collection of solids is known as raw sludge or primary solids and is said to be fresh before anaerobic processes become active. The sludge will become putrescent in a short time once anaerobic bacteria take over and must be removed from the sedimentation tank before this happens. This is accomplished in one of two ways. In an Imhoff tank fresh sludge is passed through a slot to the lower story or digestion chamber where it is decomposed by anaerobic bacteria resulting in liquefaction and reduced volume of the sludge. After digesting for an extended period the result is called digested sludge and may be disposed of by drying and then landfilling. More commonly with domestic sewage the fresh sludge is continuously extracted from the tank mechanically and passed to separate sludge digestion tanks that operate at higher temperatures than the lower story of the Imhoff tank and as a result digest much more rapidly and efficiently. Biosolids is a term often used in conjunction with reuse of sewage solids after sewage sludge treatment. Biosolids can be defined as organic wastewater solids that can be reused after stabilization processes such as anaerobic digestion and composting. Opponents of sewage sludge reuse reject this term as a public relations term. attribution needed Class A sludge is typically dried and pasteurized and is also known as exceptional quality. Class B includes all sludge not classified as Class A. Class B sludge is typically undigested and is volatile. Both classes of sludge may still contain radioactive or pharmaceutical wastes. The amount of sewage sludge produced is proportional to the amount and concentration of wastewater treated and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks if they are part of the process configuration plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step. For example primary sedimentation produces about kg ML of so called primary sludge with a value of kg ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated one mega litre ML is m. Of the biological treatment processes the activated sludge process produces about kg ML of waste activated sludge and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process kg ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of kg ML being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge. United States municipal wastewater treatment plants in produced about . million dry tons of sewage sludge and about . million dry tons in according to EPA estimates. As of about of all sewage sludge was applied to land as a soil amendment and fertilizer for growing crops. Production of sewage sludge can be reduced by conversion from flush toilets to dry toilets such urine diverting dry toilets and composting toilets. Bacteria in Class A sludge products can actually regrow under certain environmental conditions. Pathogens could easily remain undetected in untreated sewage sludge. Pathogens are not a significant health issue if sewage sludge is properly treated and site specific management practices are followed. Micro pollutants clarification needed can become concentrated in sewage sludge. Each of these disposal options comes with myriad potential and in some cases proven human health and environment impacts. Sterols and other hormones have been detected. One of the main concerns in the treated sludge is the concentrated metals content arsenic cadmium copper etc. some of which are also critical plant micronutrients clarification needed certain metals are regulated while others are not. Leaching methods can be used to reduce the metal content and meet the regulatory limit. In the EPA released the Targeted National Sewage Sludge Study which reports on the level of metals chemicals hormones and other materials present in a statistical sample of sewage sludges. Some highlights include Sewage treatment plants receive various forms of hazardous waste from hospitals nursing homes industry and households. Low levels of constituents such as PCBs dioxin and brominated flame retardants may remain in treated sludge. There are potentially thousands other components of sludge that remain untested undetected disposed of from modern society that also end up in sludge pharmaceuticals nano particles etc. which have been proven to be hazardous to both human and ecological health. In in South Carolina PCBs were discovered in very high levels in wastewater sludge. The problem was not discovered until thousands of acres of farm land in South Carolina were contaminated by this hazardous material. SCDHEC issued emergency regulatory order banning all PCB laden sewage sludge from being land applied on farm fields or deposited into landfills in South Carolina. Also in after DHEC request the city of Charlotte decided to stop land applying sewage sludge in South Carolina while authorities investigated the source of PCB contamination. In February the city of Charlotte admitted PCBs have entered their sewage treatment centers as well. Contaminants of concern in sewage sludge are plasticizers PDBEs and others generated by human activities including personal care products and medicines. Synthetic fibers from fabrics persist in treated sewage sludge as well as in biosolids treated soils and may thus serve as an indicator of past biosolids application. The term pollutant is defined as part of the EPA rule. The components of sludge have pollutant limits defined by the EPA. A Pollutant is an organic substance an inorganic substance a combination of organic and inorganic substances or a pathogenic organism that after discharge and upon exposure ingestion inhalation or assimilation into an organism either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food chain could on the basis of information available to the Administrator of EPA cause death disease behavioral abnormalities cancer genetic mutations physiological malfunctions including malfunction in reproduction or physical deformations in either organisms or offspring of the organisms. The maximum component pollutant limits by the US EPA are Sewage sludge treatment is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater. Sewage sludge is produced from the treatment of wastewater in sewage treatment plants and consists of two basic forms raw primary sludge and secondary sludge also known as activated sludge in the case of the activated sludge process. Sewage sludge is usually treated by one or several of the following treatment steps lime stabilization thickening dewatering drying anaerobic digestion or composting. Some treatment processes such as composting and alkaline stabilization that involve significant amendments may affect contaminant strength and concentration depending on the process and the contaminant in question treatment may decrease or in some cases increase the bioavailability and or solubility of contaminants. Following treatment sewage sludge is either landfilled incinerated applied on agricultural land or in some cases retailed or given away for free to the general public. In the EPA commissioned a study at the United States National Research Council NRC to determine the health risks of sludge. In this document the NRC pointed out that many of the dangers of sludge are unknown and unassessed. Additionally Regulations that limit contact with biosolids do not prevent environmental processes in the conceptual model such as aerosolization or erosion and the death or multiplication of pathogens. citation needed The National Research Council published Biosolids Applied to Land Advancing Standards and Practices in July . The NRC concluded that while there is no documented scientific evidence that sewage sludge regulations have failed to protect public health there is persistent uncertainty on possible adverse health effects. The NRC noted that further research is needed and made about recommendations for addressing public health concerns scientific uncertainties and data gaps in the science underlying the sewage sludge standards. The EPA responded with a commitment to conduct research addressing the NRC recommendations. Residents living near Class B sludge processing sites may experience asthma or pulmonary distress due to bioaerosols released from sludge fields. A survey of individuals near affected sites found that most reported irritation symptoms about half reported an infection within a month of the application and about a fourth were affected by Staphylococcus aureus including two deaths. The number of reported S. aureus infections was times as high as in hospitalized patients a high risk group. The authors point out that regulations call for protective gear when handling Class B biosolids and that similar protections could be considered for residents in nearby areas given the wind conditions. Khuder Milz Bisesi Vincent McNulty and Czajkowski as cited by Harrison and McBride of the Cornell Waste Management Institute in Case for Caution Revisited Health and Environmental Impacts of Application of Sewage Sludges to Agricultural Land conducted a health survey of persons living in close proximity to Class B sludged land. A sample of people exposed to Class B sludge living within mile . km of sludged land and using a control group of people not exposed to sludge not living within mile . km of sludged land reported the following .mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden margin em padding px .mw parser output .templatequote .templatequotecite line height .em text align left padding left .em margin top Results revealed that some reported health related symptoms were statistically significantly elevated among the exposed residents including excessive secretion of tears abdominal bloating jaundice skin ulcer dehydration weight loss and general weakness. The frequency of reported occurrence of bronchitis upper respiratory infection and giardiasis were also statistically significantly elevated. The findings suggest an increased risk for certain respiratory gastrointestinal and other diseases among residents living near farm fields on which the use of biosolids was permitted. Although correlation does not imply causation such extensive correlations may lead reasonable people to conclude that precaution is necessary in dealing with sludge and sludged farmlands. Harrison and Oakes suggest that in particular until investigations are carried out that answer these questions ...about the safety of Class B sludge... land application of Class B sludges should be viewed as a practice that subjects neighbors and workers to substantial risk of disease. They further suggest that even Class A treated sludge may have chemical contaminants including heavy metals such as lead or endotoxins present and a precautionary approach may be justified on this basis though the vast majority of incidents reported by Lewis et al. have been correlated with exposure to Class B untreated sludge and not Class A treated sludge. A report by the state of North Carolina concluded that a surveillance program of humans living near application sites should be developed to determine if there are adverse health effects in humans and animals as a result of biosolids application. After treatment and dependent upon the quality of sludge produced for example with regards to heavy metal content sewage sludge is most commonly either disposed of in landfills dumped in the ocean or applied to land for its fertilizing properties as pioneered by the product Milorganite. It used to be common practice to dump sewage sludge into the ocean however this practice has stopped in many nations due to environmental concerns as well to domestic and international laws and treaties. citation needed Biosolids is a term widely used to denote the byproduct of domestic and commercial sewage and wastewater treatment that is to be used in agriculture. National regulations that dictate the practice of land application of treated sewage sludge differ widely and e.g. in the US there are widespread disputes about this practice. Depending on their level of treatment and resultant pollutant content biosolids can be used in regulated applications for non food agriculture food agriculture or distribution for unlimited use. Treated biosolids can be produced in cake granular pellet or liquid form and are spread over land before being incorporated into the soil or injected directly into the soil by specialist contractors. Such use was pioneered by the production of Milorganite in . Use of sewage sludge has shown an increase in level of soil available phosphorus and soil salinity. The findings of a year field study of air land and water in Arizona concluded that use of biosolids is sustainable and improves the soil and crops. Other studies report that plants uptake large quantities of heavy metals and toxic pollutants that are retained by produce which is then consumed by humans. A PhD thesis studying the addition of sludge to neutralize soil acidity concluded that the practice was not recommended if large amounts are used because the sludge produces acids when it oxidizes. Studies have indicated that pharmaceuticals and personal care products which often adsorb to sludge during wastewater treatment can persist in agricultural soils following biosolid application. Some of these chemicals including potential endocrine disruptor Triclosan can also travel through the soil column and leach into agricultural tile drainage at detectable levels. Other studies however have shown that these chemicals remain adsorbed to surface soil particles making them more susceptible to surface erosion than infiltration. These studies are also mixed in their findings regarding the persistence of chemicals such as triclosan triclocarban and other pharmaceuticals. The impact of this persistence in soils is unknown but the link to human and land animal health is likely tied to the capacity for plants to absorb and accumulate these chemicals in their consumed tissues. Studies of this kind are in early stages but evidence of root uptake and translocation to leaves did occur for both triclosan and triclocarban in soybeans. This effect was not present in corn when tested in a different study. A cautionary approach to land application of biosolids has been advocated by some for regions where soils have lower capacities for toxics absorption or due to the presence of unknowns in sewage biosolids. In the Northeast Regional Multi State Research Committee NEC issued conservative guidelines tailored to the soils and conditions typical of the northeastern US. Use of sewage sludge is prohibited for produce to be labeled USDA certified organic. In the United States grocery chain Whole Foods banned produce grown in sewage sludge. Treated sewage sludge has been used in the UK Europe and China agriculturally for more than years though there is increasing pressure in some countries to stop the practice of land application due to farm land contamination and public outrage. In the s there was pressure in some European countries to ban the use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer. Switzerland Sweden Austria and others introduced a ban. Since the s there has been cooperative activity with industry to reduce the inputs of persistent substances from factories. This has been very successful and for example the content of cadmium in sewage sludge in major European cities is now only of what it was in . Sludge can also be incinerated in sludge incineration plants which comes with its own set of environmental concerns air pollution disposal of the ash . Pyrolysis of the sludge to create syngas and potentially biochar is possible as is combustion of biofuel produced from drying sewage sludge or incineration in a waste to energy facility for direct production of electricity and steam for district heating or industrial uses. Thermal processes can greatly reduce the volume of the sludge as well as achieve remediation of all or some of the biological concerns. Direct waste to energy incineration and complete combustion systems such as the Gate Energy System will require multi step cleaning of the exhaust gas to ensure no hazardous substances are released. In addition the ash produced by incineration or incomplete combustion processes such as fluidized bed dryers may be difficult to use without subsequent treatment due to high heavy metal content solutions to this include leaching of the ashes to remove heavy metals or in the case of ash produced in a complete combustion process or with biochar produced from a pyrolytic process the heavy metals may be fixed in place and the ash material readily usable as a LEEDs preferred additive to concrete or asphalt. Examples of other ways to use dried sewage sludge as an energy resource include the Gate Energy System an innovative process to power a steam turbine using heat from burning milled and dried sewage sludge or combining dried sewage sludge with coal in coal fired power stations. In both cases this allows for production of electricity with less carbon dioxide emissions than conventional coal fired power stations. European legislation on dangerous substances has eliminated the production and marketing of some substances that have been of historic concern such as persistent organic micropollutants. The European Commission has said repeatedly that the Directive on the protection of the environment and in particular of the soil when sewage sludge is used in agriculture EEC has been very successful in that there have been no cases of adverse effect where it has been applied. The EC encourages the use of sewage sludge in agriculture because it conserves organic matter and completes nutrient cycles. Recycling of phosphate is regarded as especially important because the phosphate industry predicts that at the current rate of extraction the economic reserves will be exhausted in or at most years. Phosphate can be recovered with minimal capital expenditure as technology currently exists but municipalities have little political will to attempt nutrient extraction instead opting for a take all the other stuff mentality. unreliable source According to the EPA biosolids that meet treatment and pollutant content criteria of Part . can be safely recycled and applied as fertilizer to sustainably improve and maintain productive soils and stimulate plant growth. However they can not be disposed of in a sludge only landfill under Part . because of high chromium levels and boundary restrictions. Biosolids that meet the Class B pathogen treatment and pollutant criteria in accordance with the EPA Standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge CFR Part can be land applied with formal site restrictions and strict record keeping. Biosolids that meet Class A pathogen reduction requirements or equivalent treatment by a Process to Further Reduce Pathogens PFRP have the least restrictions on use. PFRPs include pasteurization heat drying thermophilic composting aerobic digestion most common method and beta or gamma ray irradiation. The EPA Office of the Inspector General OIG completed two assessments in and of the EPA sewage sludge program. The follow up report in documented that the EPA cannot assure the public that current land application practices are protective of human health and the environment. The report also documented that there had been an almost reduction in EPA enforcement resources since the earlier assessment. This is probably the greatest issue with the practice under both the federal program operated by the EPA and those of the several states there is limited inspection and oversight by agencies charged with regulating these practices. To some degree this lack of oversight is a function of the perceived by the regulatory agencies benign nature of the practice. However a greater underlying issue is funding. Few states and the US EPA have the discretionary funds necessary to establish and implement a full enforcement program for biosolids. As detailed in the Plain English Guide to the Part Risk Assessment the EPA s most comprehensive risk assessment was completed for biosolids. Since when sewage was first treated the amount of sludge has increased along with population and more advanced treatment technology secondary treatment in addition to primary treatment . In the case of New York City at first the sludge was discharged directly along the banks of rivers surrounding the city then later piped further into the rivers and then further still out into the harbor. In to relieve a dismal condition in New York Harbor New York City began dumping sludge at sea at a location in the New York Bight called the Mile Site. This was deemed a successful public health measure and not until the late s was there any examination of its consequences to marine life or to humans. There was accumulation of sludge particles on the seafloor and consequent changes in the numbers and types of benthic organisms. In a large area around the site was closed to shellfishing. From then until to the practice of dumping at the Mile Site came under increasing pressure stemming from a series of untoward environmental crises in the New York Bight that were attributed partly to sludge dumping. In sludge dumping was moved still further seaward to a site over the deep ocean called the Mile Site. Then again in response to political pressure arising from events unrelated to ocean dumping the practice ended entirely in . Since New York City sludge has been applied to land outside of New York state . The wider question is whether or not changes on the sea floor caused by the portion of sludge that settles are severe enough to justify the added operational cost and human health concerns of applying sludge to land. After the Congressional ban on ocean dumping the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA instituted a policy of digested sludge reuse on agricultural land. The US EPA promulgated regulations CFR Part that continued to allow the use of biosolids on land as fertilizers and soil amendments which had been previously allowed under Part . The EPA promoted biosolids recycling throughout the s. The EPA s Part regulations were developed with input from university EPA and USDA researchers from around the country and involved an extensive review of the scientific literature and the largest risk assessment the agency had conducted to that time. The Part regulations became effective in .",FALSE

During the phase of product planning consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined. During the phase of product development specific design specifications are finalized models are built and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a prototype is available LCA is used as a fundamental standard to identify significant social and environmental aspects and quantify environmental impact. Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized it enters the maturity phase which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages during the first stage of maturity the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. Where applicable end of life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU the take back of end of life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.",FALSE
"53",53,"biochar","/wiki/Biochar",FALSE,0,"null","Biochar is charcoal used as a soil amendment","Biochar is charcoal used as a soil amendment. Biochar is a stable solid rich in carbon and can endure in soil for thousands of years. Like most charcoal biochar is made from biomass via pyrolysis. Biochar is under investigation as an approach to carbon sequestration as it has the potential to help mitigate climate change. It results from processes related to pyrogenic carbon capture and storage PyCCS . Independently biochar can increase soil fertility of acidic soils low pH soils increase agricultural productivity and provide protection against some foliar and soil borne diseases. Regarding the definition from the production part biochar is defined by the International Biochar Initiative as The solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen limited environment . The word biochar is an English neologism derived from the Greek word bios life and char product of carbonisation of biomass as charcoal . Pre Columbian Amazonians are believed to have used biochar to enhance soil productivity. They seem to have produced it by smoldering agricultural waste i.e. covering burning biomass with soil in pits or trenches. European settlers called it terra preta de Indio. Following observations and experiments a research team working in French Guiana hypothesized that the Amazonian earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris in the mineral soil. Biochar is a high carbon fine grained residue that today is produced through modern pyrolysis processes it is the direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen preventing combustion which produces a mixture of solids the biochar proper liquid bio oil and gas syngas products. The specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process condition such as temperature residence time and heating rate. These parameters can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar. Temperatures of C K produce more char while temperatures above C K favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components. Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures typically requiring seconds instead of hours. The increasing heating rate will also lead to a decrease of pyrolysis biochar yield while the temperature is in the range of C K . Typical yields are bio oil biochar and syngas. By comparison slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char it is this which contributes to the observed soil fertility of terra preta. Once initialized both processes produce net energy. For typical inputs the energy required to run a fast pyrolyzer is approximately of the energy that it outputs. Modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output times the amount of energy required to run. Besides pyrolysis torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization process can also thermally decompose biomass to the solid material. However these products cannot be strictly defined as biochar. The carbon product from the torrefaction process still remains some volatile organic components thus its properties are between that of biomass feedstock and biochar. Furthermore even the hydrothermal carbonization could produce a carbon rich solid product the hydrothermal carbonization is evidently different from the conventional thermal conversion process. Therefore the solid product from hydrothermal carbonization is defined as hydrochar rather than biochar . The Amazonian pit trench method harvests neither bio oil nor syngas and releases a large amount of CO black carbon and other greenhouse gases GHGs and potentially toxins into the air though less greenhouse gasses than captured during the growth of the biomass. Commercial scale systems process agricultural waste paper byproducts and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products. The production of biochar as an output is not a priority in most cases. In a centralized system all biomass in a region is brought to a central plant i.e. biomass fueled thermal power station for processing into biochar. Alternatively each farmer or group of farmers can operate a lower tech kiln. Finally a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass. Vehicle power comes from the syngas stream while the biochar remains on the farm. The biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site. Factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts the amount of material to be processed and the ability to feed directly into the power grid. The most common crops used for making biochar include various tree species as well as various energy crops. Some of these energy crops ie Napier grass can also store much more carbon on a shorter timespan than trees do. For crops that are not exclusively for biochar production the Residue to Product Ratio RPR and the collection factor CF the percent of the residue not used for other things measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product. For instance Brazil harvests approximately million tons MT of sugarcane annually with an RPR of . and a CF of . for the sugarcane tops which normally are burned in the field. This translates into approximately MT of residue annually which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives. Adding in the bagasse sugarcane waste RPR . CF . which is otherwise burned inefficiently in boilers raises the total to MT of pyrolysis feedstock. Some plant residue however must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers. Pyrolysis technologies for processing loose and leafy biomass produce both biochar and syngas. Alternatively thermo catalytic depolymerization which utilizes microwaves has recently been used to efficiently convert organic matter to biochar on an industrial scale producing char. The physical and chemical properties of biochars as determined by feedstocks and technologies are crucial for the application of biochars in the industry and environment. Different characterization data are employed to biochars and determine their performances in a specific use. For example the guidelines published by the International Biochar Initiative provide standardized methods in evaluating the product quality of biochar for soil application. The properties of biochar can be characterized in several respects including the proximate and elemental composition pH value porosity etc. which correlate with different biochar properties. The atomic ratios of biochar including H C and O C correlate with the biochar properties that are relevant to the organic content such as polarity and aromaticity. The van Krevelen diagram can be used to show the evolution of biochar atomic ratios in the production process. In the carbonization process both the H C and O C ratio decreased due to the release of functional groups which contain hydrogen and oxygen. The burning and natural decomposition of biomass and in particular agricultural waste adds large amounts of CO to the atmosphere. Biochar is a stable way of storing carbon in the ground for centuries potentially reducing or stalling the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality increase soil fertility raise agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. Biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years like coal. Such a carbon negative technology would lead to a net withdrawal of CO from the atmosphere while producing consumable energy. This technique is advocated by prominent scientists such as James Hansen head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and James Lovelock creator of the Gaia hypothesis for mitigation of global warming by greenhouse gas remediation. Researchers have estimated that sustainable use of biocharring could reduce the global net emissions of carbon dioxide CO methane and nitrous oxide by up to . Pg CO C equivalent CO Ce per year of current anthropogenic CO Ce emissions Pg Gt and total net emissions over the course of the next century by Pg CO Ce without endangering food security habitat or soil conservation. Biochar is recognized as offering a number of benefits for soil health. Many benefits are related to the extremely porous nature of biochar. This structure is found to be very effective at retaining both water and water soluble nutrients. Soil biologist Elaine Ingham indicates the extreme suitability of biochar as a habitat for many beneficial soil micro organisms. She points out that when pre charged with these beneficial organisms biochar becomes an extremely effective soil amendment promoting good soil and in turn plant health. Biochar has also been shown to reduce leaching of E coli through sandy soils depending on application rate feedstock pyrolysis temperature soil moisture content soil texture and surface properties of the bacteria. For plants that require high potash and elevated pH biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve yield. Biochar can improve water quality reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases reduce nutrient leaching reduce soil acidity and reduce irrigation and fertilizer requirements. Biochar was also found under certain circumstances to induce plant systemic responses to foliar fungal diseases and to improve plant responses to diseases caused by soilborne pathogens. The various impacts of biochar can be dependent on the properties of the biochar as well as the amount applied and there is still a lack of knowledge about the important mechanisms and properties. Biochar impact may depend on regional conditions including soil type soil condition depleted or healthy temperature and humidity. Modest additions of biochar to soil reduce nitrous oxide NO emissions by up to and eliminate methane emissions which are both more potent greenhouse gases than CO. Studies have reported positive effects from biochar on crop production in degraded and nutrient poor soils. The application of compost and biochar under FP project FERTIPLUS has had positive effects in soil humidity and crop productivity and quality in different countries. Biochar can be designed with specific qualities to target distinct properties of soils. In a Colombian savanna soil biochar reduced leaching of critical nutrients created a higher crop uptake of nutrients and provided greater soil availability of nutrients. At levels biochar reduced contaminant levels in plants by up to while reducing total chlordane and DDX content in the plants by and respectively. On the other hand because of its high adsorption capacity biochar may reduce the efficacy of soil applied pesticides that are needed for weed and pest control. High surface area biochars may be particularly problematic in this regard more research into the long term effects of biochar addition to soil is needed. Switching from slash and burn to slash and char farming techniques in Brazil can decrease both deforestation of the Amazon basin and carbon dioxide emission as well as increase crop yields. Slash and burn leaves only of the carbon from the organic material in the soil. Slash and char can keep up to of the carbon in a highly stable form. Returning the biochar into the soil rather than removing it all for energy production reduces the need for nitrogen fertilizers thereby reducing cost and emissions from fertilizer production and transport. Additionally by improving the soil s ability to be tilled its fertility and its productivity biochar enhanced soils can indefinitely sustain agricultural production whereas non enriched soils quickly become depleted of nutrients forcing farmers to abandon the fields producing a continuous slash and burn cycle and the continued loss of tropical rainforest. Using pyrolysis to produce bio energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for cellulosic ethanol does. Additionally the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer. Biochar is hygroscopic. Thus it is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water. This is possible because of its porous structure and high specific surface area. As a result nutrients such as phosphate and agrochemicals are retained for the plants benefit. Plants are therefore healthier and less fertilizer leaches into surface or groundwater. Mobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process. Bio oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition and unless carefully cleaned contains some biochar particles which can block injectors. Currently it is less suitable for use as a kind of biodiesel than other sources. If biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal. Pyrolysis also may be the most cost effective way of electricity generation from biomaterial. Intensive research into manifold aspects involving the pyrolysis biochar platform is underway around the world. From to there were articles that included the word biochar or bio char in the topic that had been indexed in the ISI Web of Science. Further research is in progress by such diverse institutions around the world as Cornell University the University of Edinburgh which has a dedicated research unit University of Georgia the Agricultural Research Organization ARO of Israel Volcani Center where a network of researchers involved in biochar research iBRN Israel Biochar Researchers Network was established as early as and the University of Delaware. Long term effect of biochar on soil C sequestration of recent carbon inputs has been examined using soil from arable fields in Belgium with charcoal enriched black spots dating years ago from historical charcoal production mound kilns. Topsoils from these black spots had a higher organic C concentration . . organic carbon OC than adjacent soils outside these black spots . . OC . The soils had been cropped with maize for at least years which provided a continuous input of C with a C isotope signature C . distinct from the C of soil organic carbon . and charcoal . collected in the surrounding area. The isotope signatures in the soil revealed that maize derived C concentration was significantly higher in charcoal amended samples black spots than in adjacent unamended ones . vs. . P . . Topsoils were subsequently collected as a gradient across two black spots along with corresponding adjacent soils outside these black spots and soil respiration and physical soil fractionation was conducted. Total soil respiration days was unaffected by charcoal but the maize derived C respiration per unit maize derived OC in soil significantly decreased about half P . with increasing charcoal derived C in soil. Maize derived C was proportionally present more in protected soil aggregates in the presence of charcoal. The lower specific mineralization and increased C sequestration of recent C with charcoal are attributed to a combination of physical protection C saturation of microbial communities and potentially slightly higher annual primary production. Overall this study provides evidence of the capacity of biochar to enhance C sequestration in soils through reduced C turnover on the long term. Hernandez Soriano et al . Biochar sequesters carbon C in soils because of its prolonged residence time ranging from several years to millennia. In addition biochar can promote indirect C sequestration by increasing crop yield while potentially reducing C mineralization. Laboratory studies have evidenced effects of biochar on C mineralization using C isotope signatures. Kerre et al Fluorescence analysis of the dissolved organic matter from soil amended with biochar revealed that biochar application increased a humic like fluorescent component likely associated with biochar carbon in solution. The combined spectroscopy microscopy approach revealed the accumulation of aromatic carbon in discrete spots in the solid phase of microaggregates and its co localization with clay minerals for soil amended with raw residue or biochar. The co localization of aromatic C polysaccharides C was consistently reduced upon biochar application. These finding suggested that reduced C metabolism is an important mechanism for C stabilization in biochar amended soils Hernandez Soriano et al Students at Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey are developing supercapacitors that use electrodes made of biochar. A process developed by University of Florida researchers that removes phosphate from water also yields methane gas usable as fuel and phosphate laden carbon suitable for enriching soil. Researchers at the University of Auckland are also working on utilizing biochar in concrete applications to reduce carbon emissions during concrete production and to improve the strength considerably. It has also demonstrated that the biochar can be used as a suitable filler in polymer matrix. Recently biochar starch bio composites were prepared and its nano mechanical behavious were investigated using advanced dynamic atomic force microscopy. If biomass is pyrolyzed to biochar and put back into the soil rather than being completely burned this may reduce carbon emissions. Potentially the bioenergy industry might even be made to sequester net carbon. Pyrolysis might be cost effective for a combination of sequestration and energy production when the cost of a CO ton reaches . Carbon credits could help to make implementation easier as most large biomass power producers are neither equipped to create biochar nor are financially motivated for making it because implementing biochar production would leave less energy for power production . Current biochar projects make no significant impact on the overall global carbon budget although expansion of this technique has been advocated as a geoengineering approach. In May the Biochar Fund a small social profit organization received a grant from the Congo Basin Forest Fund for a project in Central Africa to simultaneously slow down deforestation increase the food security of rural communities provide renewable energy and sequester carbon. Though some farmers did report better maize crops the project ended early without significant results and with promises to the farmers not kept. Application rates of . tonnes per hectare . . t acre appear to be required to produce significant improvements in plant yields. Biochar costs in developed countries vary from tonne generally too high for the farmer horticulturalist and prohibitive for low input field crops. In developing countries constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time. An alternative is to use small amounts of biochar in lower cost biochar fertilizer complexes. Various companies in North America Australia and England sell biochar or biochar production units. In Sweden the Stockholm Solution is an urban tree planting system that uses biochar to support healthy growth of the urban forest. The Qatar Aspire Park now uses biochar to help trees cope with the intense heat of their summers citation needed . At the International Biochar Conference a mobile pyrolysis unit with a specified intake of pounds kg was introduced for agricultural applications. The unit had a length of feet and height of feet . m by .m . A production unit in Dunlap Tennessee by Mantria Corporation opened in August after testing and an initial run was later shut down as part of a Ponzi scheme investigation. ",FALSE

A biogas is a gaseous form of methane obtained from biomass. By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid within existing appliances. Renewable natural gas is a subset of synthetic natural gas or substitute natural gas SNG . Renewable natural gas can be produced and distributed via the existing gas grid making it an attractive means of supplying existing premises with renewable heat and renewable gas energy while requiring no extra capital outlay of the customer. The existing gas network also allows distribution of gas energy over vast distances at a minimal cost in energy. Existing networks would allow biogas to be sourced from remote markets that are rich in low cost biomass Russia or Scandinavia for example . Renewable natural gas can also be converted into liquefied natural gas LNG for direct use as fuel in transport sector. The UK National Grid believes that at least of all gas consumed could be made from matter such as sewage food waste such as food thrown away by supermarkets and restaurants and organic waste created by businesses such as breweries. In the United States analysis conducted in by the Gas Technology Institute determined that renewable gas from waste biomass including agricultural waste has the potential to add up to . quadrillion Btu annually being enough to meet the natural gas needs of of American homes. In combination with power to gas whereby the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide fraction of biogas are converted to methane using electrolyzed hydrogen the renewable gas potential of raw biogas is approximately doubled. Many ways of methanising carbon dioxide monoxide and hydrogen exist including biomethanation the sabatier process and a new electrochemical process pioneered in the United States currently undergoing trials. A biomass to SNG efficiency of can be achieved. Costs are minimised by maximising production scale and by locating an anaerobic digestion plant next to transport links e.g. a port or river for the chosen source of biomass. The existing gas storage infrastructure would allow the plant to continue to manufacture gas at the full utilisation rate even during periods of weak demand helping minimise manufacturing capital costs per unit of gas produced. Renewable gas can be produced through three main processes Gteborg Energi opened the first demonstration plant for large scale production of bio SNG through gasification of forest residues in Gothenburg Sweden within the GoBiGas project. The plant had the capacity to produce megawatts worth of bioSNG from about MW worth of biomass aiming at a conversion efficiency of . From December the bioSNG plant was fully operational and supplied gas to the Swedish natural gas grid reaching the quality demands with a methane content of over . The plant was permanently closed due to economic problems in April . Gteborg Energi had invested million euro in the plant and intensive attempts for a year to sell the plant to new investors had failed . It can be noted that the plant was a technical success and performed as intended. However natural gas is at a very low price given market conditions globally. It is expected the plant is to re emerge around when economic conditions may be more favourable with the possibility of a higher carbon price. SNG is of particular interest in countries with extensive natural gas distribution networks. Core advantages of SNG include compatibility with existing natural gas infrastructure higher efficiency that Fisher Tropsch fuels production and smaller production scale than other second generation biofuel production systems. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands has conducted extensive research on large scale SNG production from woody biomass based on the importation of feedstocks from abroad. Renewable natural gas plants based on wood can be categorised into two main categories one being allothermal which has the energy provided by a source outside of the gasifier. One example is the double chambered fluidised bed gasifiers consisting of a separate combustion and gasification chambers. Autothermal systems generate the heat within the gasifier but require the use of pure oxygen to avoid nitrogen dilution. In the UK NNFCC found that any UK bioSNG plant built by would be highly likely to use clean woody feedstocks and that there are several regions with good availability of that source. In the UK using anaerobic digestion is growing as a means of producing renewable biogas with nearly biomethane injection sites built across the country. Ecotricity announced plans to supply green gas to UK consumers via the national grid. Centrica also announced that it would begin injecting gas manufactured from sewage into the gas grid. In Canada FortisBC a gas provider in British Columbia injects renewably created natural gas into its existing gas distribution system. Sustainable SNG is produced by high temperature oxygen blown slagging co gasification at to bar pressure of biomass or waste residue. The advantage of a wide range of feedstocks is that much larger quantities of renewable SNG can be produced compared with biogas with fewer supply chain limitations. A wide range of fuels with an overall biogenic carbon content of to is technically and financially viable. Hydrogen is added to the fuel mix during the gasification process and carbon dioxide is removed by capture from the purge gas slip stream syngas clean up and catalytic methanation stages. Large scale sustainable SNG will enable the UK gas and electricity grids to be substantially de carbonised in parallel at source while maintaining the existing operational and economic relationship between the gas and electricity grids. Carbon capture and sequestration can be added at little additional cost thereby progressively achieving deeper de carbonisation of the existing gas and electricity grids at low cost and operational risk. Cost benefit studies indicate that large scale biogenic carbon content sustainable SNG can be injected into the high pressure gas transmission grid at a cost of around p therm. At this cost it is possible to re process fossil natural gas used as an energy input into the gasification process into to times greater quantity of sustainable SNG. Large scale sustainable SNG combined with continuing natural gas production from UK continental shelf and unconventional gas will potentially enable the cost of UK peak electricity to be de coupled from international oil denominated take or pay gas supply contracts. Applications Biogas creates similar environmental pollutants as ordinary natural gas fuel such as carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide hydrogen sulfide and particulates. Any unburned gas that escapes contains methane a long lived greenhouse gas. The key difference from fossil natural gas is that it is often considered partly or fully carbon neutral citation needed since the carbon dioxide contained in the biomass is naturally renewed in each generation of plants rather than being released from fossil stores and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.",FALSE

There is the potential to recycle many elements of construction waste. Often roll off containers are used to transport the waste. Rubble can be crushed and reused in construction projects. Waste wood can also be recovered and recycled. Where recycling is not an option the disposal of construction waste and hazardous materials must be carried out according to legislation of relevant councils and regulatory bodies. The penalties for improper disposal of construction waste and hazardous waste including asbestos can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars for businesses and individuals. In England all personnel performing builders or construction waste clearance are required by law to be working for a CIS registered business. C D materials Construction Demolition materials. The traditional disposal way for construction waste is to send it to landfill sites. Sending the waste directly to a landfill causes many problems",FALSE
"56",56,"business cluster","/wiki/Business_cluster",TRUE,0,"field|part|","A business cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected businesses suppliers and associated institutions in a particular field","A business cluster is a geographic concentration of interconnected businesses suppliers and associated institutions in a particular field. Clusters are considered to increase the productivity with which companies can compete nationally and globally. In urban studies the term agglomeration is used. Clusters are also important aspects of strategic management. The term business cluster also known as an industry cluster competitive cluster or Porterian cluster was introduced and popularized by Michael Porter in The Competitive Advantage of Nations . The importance of economic geography or more correctly geographical economics was also brought to attention by Paul Krugman in Geography and Trade . Cluster development has since become a focus for many government programs. The underlying concept which economists have referred to as agglomeration economies dates back to and the work of Alfred Marshall. Michael Porter claims that clusters have the potential to affect competition in three ways by increasing the productivity of the companies in the cluster by driving innovation in the field and by stimulating new businesses in the field. According to Porter in the modern global economy comparative advantage how certain locations have special endowments i.e. harbor cheap labor to overcome heavy input costs is less relevant. Now competitive advantage how companies make productive use of inputs requiring continual innovation is more important. Porter argues that economic activities are embedded in social activities that social glue binds clusters together . This is supported by recent research showing that particularly in regional and rural areas significantly more innovation takes place in communities which have stronger inter personal networks. Put in another way a business cluster is a geographical location where enough resources and competences amass reach a critical threshold giving it a key position in a given economic branch of activity and with a decisive sustainable competitive advantage over other places or even a world supremacy in that field e.g. Silicon Valley and Hollywood . A cluster is most of the time the result of initiatives since it implies to convince current competitors to work jointly. The initiative usually comes from the political sphere e.g. the different Singaporian clusters but it can also come from the industry itself e.g. the initiative of Bart J. Groot the director of Dow Olefinverbund GmbH a major chemicals complex at the intersection of three Eastearn Germany states Saxony Saxony Anhalt and Thuringia after the reunification. The goal was to encourage coordination among political and administrative officials of Mitteldeutschland. Following development of the concept of interorganizational networks in Germany and practical development of clusters in the United Kingdom many perceive there to be four methods by which a cluster can be identified It is also expected particularly in the German model of organizational networks that interconnected businesses must interact and have firm actions within at least two separate levels of the organizations concerned. Several types of business clusters based on different kinds of knowledge are recognized The process of identifying defining and describing a cluster is not standardized. Individual economic consultants and researchers develop their own methodologies. All cluster analysis relies on evaluation of local and regional employment patterns based on industrial categorizations such as NAICS or the increasingly obsolete SIC codes. Notable databases providing statistical data on clusters and industry agglomeration include An alternative to clusters reflecting the distributed nature of business operations in the wake of globalization is hubs and nodes. In the mid to late s several successful computer technology related companies emerged in Silicon Valley in California. This led anyone who wished to create a startup company to do so in Silicon Valley. The surge in the number of Silicon Valley startups led to a number of venture capital firms relocating to or expanding their Valley offices. This in turn encouraged more entrepreneurs to locate their startups there. In other words venture capitalists sellers of finance and dot com startups buyers of finance clustered in and around a geographical area. The cluster effect in the capital market also led to a cluster effect in the labor market. As an increasing number of companies started up in Silicon Valley programmers engineers etc. realized that they would find greater job opportunities by moving to Silicon Valley. This concentration of technically skilled people in the valley meant that startups around the country knew that their chances of finding job candidates with the proper skill sets were higher in the valley hence giving them added incentive to move there. This in turn led to more high tech workers moving there. Similar effects have also been found in the Cambridge IT Cluster UK . In the late s the Seoul Metropolitan Government in South Korea developed the Digital Media City DMC a acre complex four miles outside of the city s central business district in the Sangam dong district. With Seoul s rapidly growing cluster of multi media IT and entertainment industries the Digital Media City through its vibrant agglomeration helped to promote these industries and companies whose core business required use of information communication and media technologies. DMC grew and prospered as a global business environment raising Seoul as an east Asian hub of commerce. The cluster of its digital media related high tech firms spawned partnerships which in turn leveraged both human and social capital in the area. Eventually DMC fed the innovation of more than small scale Internet game and telecommunication firms located in Seoul. In development of DMC the Seoul government leveraged initial funding by private technology partners and developers. It is also provided IT broadband and wireless networks to the area as well as needed infrastructure. The Seoul government even provided tax incentives and favorable land prices for magnet tenants who would attract other firms to the area due to established business relationships and through their presence which would in turn promote DMC as a prime location. With such a concentration of these entities Seoul has become a major nexus of high technology and digital media. It is home to digital media R D firms across a range of types including cultural media creation digital media technologies digital broadcasting centers technology offices and entertainment firms. Just outside the DMC complex include international firm affiliates schools moderate to low income housing commercial and convention facilities entertainment zones and the city s central rail station. The cohesive connection of industry cultural centers infrastructure and human capital has fostered Seoul as a strong metropolitan economy and South Korea the Miracle on the Han River as a storied nation transitioning from a manufacturing to an innovation economy. The cluster effect can be more easily perceived in any urban agglomeration as most kinds of commercial establishments will tend to spontaneously group themselves by category. Shoe shops or cloth shops for instance are rarely isolated from their competition. In fact it is common to find whole streets of them. The cluster effect is similar to but not the same as the network effect. It is similar in the sense that the price independent preferences of both the market and its participants are based on each one s perception of the other rather than the market simply being the sum of all its participants actions as is usually the case. Thus by being an effect greater than the sum of its causes and as it occurs spontaneously the cluster effect is a usually cited example of emergence. Governments and companies often try to use the cluster effect to promote a particular place as good for a certain type of business. For example the city of Bangalore India has utilized the cluster effect in order to convince a number of high tech companies to set up shop there. Similarly Las Vegas has benefited through the cluster effect of the gambling industry. In France the national industrial policy includes support for a specific form of business clusters called Ples de Comptitivit such as Cap Digital. Another good example is the Nano Microelectronics and Embedded Systems or in short mi Cluster that was facilitated by Corallia Cluster Initiative in Greece. Corallia introduced a bottom up phase programme framework for facilitating cluster development and was short listed among the final classification finalists for the DG REGIO s RegioStars Awards in the category Research Technological Development and Innovation . Clusters were proved to boost the innovative activity among firms of the same industry. One of the main causes that might be highlighted is the competition between the companies. Moreover except of stimulating a favorable conditions for the exchange of ideas industry specific regional concentrations also create a thick labor market input. Hence innovations increase the accumulation of the knowledge in the region which influences on the local internal economies . The cluster effect does not continue forever though. To sustain cluster performance in the long term clusters need to manage network openness to business outside the cluster while facilitating strong inter organisational relationships within the cluster. Its relative influence is also dictated by other market factors such as expected revenue strength of demand taxes competition and politics. In the case of Silicon Valley as stated above for example increased crowding in the valley led to severe shortage of office and residential space which in turn forced many companies to move to alternative locations such as Austin Texas and Raleigh Durham North Carolina even though they would have liked to stay in the valley. Sometimes cluster strategies still do not produce enough of a positive impact to be justified in certain industries. For instance in the case of Builders Square the home improvement retailer could not compete with industry leaders such as Home Depot when it could not materialize the same low costs and contracts. As a result it was presented with an option to form a merger with another home improvement retailer Hechinger to better improve their business clusters and compete with Home Depot and other industry leaders. However when it failed to do so it slowly began to fail and eventually fell into bankruptcy. Although the merger attempted to create geographic clusters to compete with the low costs of other firms costs were not lowered enough and eventually the plan failed forcing Hechinger into Chapter liquidation and Builders Square out of the industry.",FALSE
"57",57,"Life cycle thinking","/wiki/Life_cycle_thinking",TRUE,0,"approach|","Life cycle thinking is an approach to becoming mindful of how everyday life affects the environment","Life cycle thinking is an approach to becoming mindful of how everyday life affects the environment. This approach evaluates how both consuming products and engaging in activities impacts the environment but it not only evaluates them at one single step but takes a holistic picture of an entire product or activity system. This means when talking about a product and taking a life cycle thinking approach what is actually being evaluated is the impact of the activity of consuming that product. This is because by consuming a product a series of associated activities are required to make it happen. For example the raw material extraction material processing transportation distribution consumption reuse recycling and disposal must all be considered when evaluating the environmental impact. This is called the life cycle of a product. The overall idea of making a holistic evaluation of a system s effect can be defined as life cycle thinking. Life cycle thinking therefore also can be applied to the consumption of other socio economic activities such as watching a movie making arts and crafts cooking dinner or even doing homework. For example renting a movie which seems to be a harmless activity would involve burning gasoline to drive to the video store using electricity to power the television and DVD player and consuming power from the remote s batteries. When trying to analyze quantitatively the effects of life cycles limits to evaluation are subject to what assessment approach is taken because the chain reaction can become so complex that it could require decades to figure out the life cycle of a specific process. Life cycle thinking overall is a way to become more mindful of the complexities of consuming products and engaging in activities and how they affect the environment. The goal of life cycle thinking is to make people and companies more aware of how their actions impact the environment in a holistic sense rather than a one time pollution that comes as a direct result of using a product or doing an activity at one specific time. Although it is nearly impossible to undergo consumption of anything with no environmental impact life cycle thinking can help people make better alternative decisions to mitigate their environmental impact. One of the goals of life cycle thinking is to avoid burden shifting. This is to make sure that reducing the environmental impact at one stage in the life cycle does not increase the impact at other places in the cycle. For example plug in electric cars reduce the amount of gasoline burned but they increase the amount of electricity used which is usually generated by other polluting energy sources such as coal. Life cycle thinking can also demonstrate the benefits to technological innovation. For example movies can now be downloaded through television service providers and gaming devices which eliminates the need to drive to a DVD rental location. By identifying pollution costs companies can innovate to mitigate their expenses while consumers can make better alternative choices to mitigate their impact. Life cycle thinking has applications in many sectors such as the following The agriculture food sector is a big source environmental impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of a product from farm to table to disposal. Life cycle thinking works to reduce these impacts at all stages of food production. Nutrition health well being cultural identity and lifestyle are also factors that should be addressed when looking at the impacts of choices made in food production to ensure decreases in emissions and environmental impact do not occur at the expense of consumer wellbeing. A product Life Cycle Analysis involves all production and service processes involved in the manufacturing of a product throughout its life cycle. This includes the production of materials needed to make the product. Since the manufacturing sector is a big emitter of pollutants and user of natural resources pinpointing areas in which to decrease environmental impact throughout the manufacturing process is a big part of life cycle thinking. Drastic increases in atmospheric CO caused by the burning of fossil fuels has led to the search for alternative energy sources like biofuels and renewable energy sources. To analyze whether or not these alternative sources have overall less environmental impact then conventional energy sources life cycle analysis is needed. Life cycle thinking is an intricate part of finding new energy sources that have an overall smaller impact on the environment. Life cycle thinking and analysis can help reduce negative environmental impacts of waste generation and management. This includes looking at ways to reduce waste production increase recycling and dispose of waste in a more environmentally friendly way. This is complicated by differences in benefits and burdens of in different geographical regions and the fact that effects usually occur over long periods of time. Furthermore benefits and burdens of different processes can occur in many different forms and can be difficult to identify quantify and compare. Retail often accounts for a significant portion of economies and thus can have huge implications in terms of environmental impacts. The life cycle of a product in retail would include the complete supply chain of the product its use and disposal or end of life treatment. There are many uses for life cycle thinking in construction especially in terms of construction waste and waste management. Finding better ways to recycle waste and prevent waste are important to reduce negative environmental impact of the construction industry. For construction products in Europe a standardised methodology for building assessment considering Environmental Products Declarations EPD has been approved. The main standards are EN buildings and EN products . Finding alternative fuel sources are the biggest challenges to reducing negative environmental impact in the transportation sector. Biofuels are becoming increasing popular as an alternative to fossil fuels. Life cycle analysis can provide a fuller picture of the extent alternative fuel sources reduce emissions and overall environmental impact compared to conventional fuels. Service industries play a big part in adding environmental burdens especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions generated by travel and tourist industries. The service industry is expected to play a larger part in the modern economy as dematerialization or the replacement of manufactured goods by services in many firms plays a bigger role in the economy. There are many different approaches to life cycle thinking that all involve looking at life cycle generated impacts and ways to minimize these impacts. An important component to life cycle approaches is avoiding burden shifting in other words ensuring that improvements in one stage are not achieved at the expense of another stage. Approaches of impact measurement focus on decreasing environmental impact and resource use throughout all stages of a process. Commonly used approaches Life cycle assessment LCA or life cycle analysis is a technique used to assess potential environmental impacts of a product at different stages of its life. This technique takes a cradle to grave or a cradle to cradle approach and looks at environmental impacts that occur throughout the lifetime of a product from raw material extraction manufacturing and processing distribution use repair and maintenance disposal and recycling. Life cycle management is a business approach to manage the total life cycle of products and services. It follows the life cycle thinking that businesses through the activities they must perform have environmental social and economic impacts. LCM is used to understand and analyze life cycle stages of products and services of a business identify potential economic social or environmental risks and opportunities at each stage and create ways to act upon those opportunities and reduce potential risks. Life cycle costing or life cycle cost analysis is the total cost analysis of a process or system. This includes costs incurred over the life of the system and is frequently used to find most cost effective means for providing goods and services. Design for the Environment Program DfE was created in by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and works to prevent pollution and the reduce the risks pollution presents to humans and the environment. The main goals of the DfE are to promote green cleaning recognize safer industrial and consumer products through safer product labeling define best practices in production and manufacturing and identify safer chemicals for these processes based on life cycle thinking. Having said this they must know that the air pollution in USA has the mixing of liquid solid gaseous odour and noise pollution which is dangerous for human being animals and plants. Product service systems PSS are sets of marketable products and services that work together to fulfill a user s needs. This new approach is a result of firms realizing that services in combination with products can provide higher profits and customer satisfaction then simply selling products alone. Firms that use PSS work to find ways to maximize the use of their product throughout its lifetime using services to supplement its usage. PSS has been seen to have smaller environmental impact than traditional business models as the focus on services has led to a decrease in material production and consumption. This applies to life cycle thinking because it involves looking at the life cycle cost of a product i.e. maintenance and storage costs for a consumer and reducing that cost by providing services with the purchased good. Integrated product policy works to minimize environmental degradation caused by products by looking at all phases of a product s life cycle to pinpoint where taking action is most effective. This also uses a cradle to grave approach when looking at a product s life. In addition it is important that policies avoid burden shifting and do not decrease environment emissions at one stage of development at the expense of another. Policy measures used to action upon recommendations include economic instruments substance bans voluntary agreements environmental labeling and product design guidelines. There are multiple situations to which life cycle thinking can be applied including the everyday life of consumers business and government policy. By applying life cycle thinking to multiple aspects of the community consumers businesses and governments can have a largely positive aspect on the environment. This is true even if the steps taken to apply life cycle thinking are small. Each day consumers make choices as to which products they would like to use based on their needs and the different brands available. Most consumers do not take into consideration the environmental impacts of the product when they make their choice. For example consumers do not consider the product s energy usage questionable labor conditions that produced it hazardous waste from production impacts on the ecosystem or pollution of air or water. Consumers can apply life cycle thinking in multiple different ways with regards to their product choices in order to reduce their impact on the environment. Firstly consumers can choose to use products from companies who take strides towards sustainability. Many companies provide sustainability reports that consumers can read to educate themselves about the companies they buy from. By using life cycle thinking consumers can choose a company with smaller production impacts. Primarily consumer usage has the largest impact on the environment throughout a product s life. By using life cycle thinking this impact can be reduced. This would require educating consumers to make better choices about product usage. This can come from the companies who provide the service or product or from government agencies. For example consumers can ask themselves what impacts they have while using the product. Ask do I really need to use this or is there a more sustainable option such as hang drying laundry on a nice day rather than using a dryer. Consumers can educate themselves on how to become more sustainable themselves through life cycle thinking rather than relying on companies and the government to be sustainable for them. Businesses are responsible for many choices about their services and products each day. By applying life cycle thinking businesses can recognize the potential impacts of their choices. They consider how each design and manufacturing decision has an effect on the environment and how they can make it more sustainable. Businesses not only take into consideration how the product is made but also how the product will be used and disposed of by the user. Companies try to have a more sustainable product by making products recyclable or reusable. They challenging part is balancing cost and sustainable choices. Life cycle thinking allows them to see the best sustainable options but is limited when it comes to pricing these choices. Life cycle thinking for businesses entails consideration of where to obtain raw material how to manufacture the material transporting distributing using and disposing of the product. By looking at all of these phases businesses make the best choices for themselves and the consumer for a lower impact on the environment. Government plays a key role in life cycle thinking by establishing policies to regulate environmental impacts. By applying life cycle thinking policy makers can set standards that businesses and consumers need to meet. They do so by gathering information as a baseline of the environmental impact and use that to set goals based on knowledge from life cycle thinking. They can also use trends from supply chains of different businesses they regulate to determine where the biggest influence can be made to majorly reduce the impacts of the businesses. Government sectors can also use life cycle thinking to better educate consumers. Requiring labels on products describing the impacts the product has and how to use the products in order to reduce the impact can be an important role for the government. Regulating supply chains and consumers with policy is motivational as negative reinforcement. Life cycle thinking provides a methodology for creating those policies in order to have the most effective and most cost efficient means of reducing environmental impacts. Many consumers when making decisions on what to buy and what not to buy consider the environmental impact of the particular product. Policy makers recognize this desire and act to create policy that not only helps consumers do this but will do so while keeping a growing economy in mind. There are many aspects of life cycle thinking incorporated into European policy. The Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan is a piece of legislation that aims to reduce environmental impact and consumption of resources associated with the complete life cycles of goods and services. On July the European Commission presented this legislation. This proposal suggests plans on how to not only reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services but also encourages the use of more sustainable goods and production technologies. This action plan also encourages the European Union to seek out every opportunity to innovate in industry. The Integrated Product Policy is another legislative action that Europe has taken in order to facilitate life cycle thinking. The Integrated Product Policy seeks to minimize the environmental degradation caused from the manufacturing use and disposal of all products. This legislation looks at all aspects of the product s life cycle and takes action where necessary to reduce. The Thematic Strategy on Sustainable Use of Natural Resources was implemented on December to reduce environmental impacts associated with resource use and to do this in a growing economy. The objective can be described as ensuring that the consumption of resources and their associated impacts do not exceed the carrying capacity of the environment and breaking linkages between economic growth and resource use . While the term life cycle thinking is not as prominent in United States policy there are considerations of the life cycle process throughout governmental policies and programs. There are Environmental Product Declarations that are used to incorporate life cycle thinking into companies and organizations. They communicate to the consumer the environmental performance of a product or system. These declarations are based on the Life Cycle Assessment and once the assessment is complete a product or system can be certified EPD. The Environmental Protection Agency s program Design for the Environment works with individual industry sectors to compare and improve the performance and human health and environmental risks and costs of existing and alternative products processes and practices. DfE partnership projects promote integrating cleaner cheaper and smarter solutions into everyday business practices. The Design for the Environment program is also equipped with a labeling program. They allow safer products to carry these labels and they are an indication to consumers that buying these products will be safer for the environment and their families. Also the Energy Independence and Security Act of is a piece of legislation that incorporates life cycle thinking. While this exact phrase isn t listed. This act includes sections on advanced biofuels. In Title II of the act it requires the creation of Biomass based diesel which is the addition of renewable biofuels to diesel fuel and will reduce emissions by as compared to petroleum biofuel. In Title III improved standards will be implemented. Since life cycle thinking can be involved in the choices of individual consumers as well as policy makers and businesses it is very important that people are well informed about the subject and its uses. Increasing awareness of the Life Cycle Analysis technique would allow companies as well as individuals to consider multiple options for a new product. After consideration of all available options life cycle thinking would encourage selection of the most sustainable option. If more individuals practiced life cycle thinking when looking for new materials or methods they would be more aware of how the environmental cost of ownership of products can be influenced by the running costs in energy and consumables. Life cycle thinking can help people find new ways to improve environmental performance image and economic benefits. Since the decisions of global businesses and government organizations have such a large impact on the environment incorporating life cycle thinking into their actions could greatly reduce negative environmental effects and improve sustainability. Many businesses do not always consider their supply chains or the end of life processes associated with their products likewise government actions frequently consider their own country or region and do not take into account the impact that they could have on other regions. Not only could life cycle thinking help the environment it can also save the company more money and improve their reputation. If a company knows where their materials come from as well as where they will end up after they have reached the end of their useful life economic performance could be further enhanced. Also since presently so much emphasis is placed on sustainable actions the more a company shows its concern and respect for the environment the better its reputation will be. In a case study on laundry detergents it was found that washing clothes at lower temperatures resulted in energy savings and improvements in several environmental indicators like climate change acidification and photochemical ozone creation. Because the company understood the importance of life cycle thinking they made the decision to conduct a Life Cycle Analysis to find the benefits of developing a different laundry detergent. Not only did the new detergents reduce environmental impact by decreasing energy consumption it also benefitted the consumer by reducing electricity bills and helped the company by becoming a leader in the industry.",FALSE
"58",58,"plastic","/wiki/Plastic",FALSE,0,"null","Note The use of this term instead of polymer is a source of confusion and thus is not recommended"," Note The use of this term instead of polymer is a source of confusion and thus is not recommended. Plastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects. Plasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but in the class of moldable polymers this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability. Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances. They are usually synthetic most commonly derived from petrochemicals however an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters. Due to their low cost ease of manufacture versatility and imperviousness to water plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale including paper clips and spacecraft. They have prevailed over traditional materials such as wood stone horn and bone leather metal glass and ceramic in some products previously left to natural materials. In developed economies about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping plumbing or vinyl siding. Other uses include automobiles up to plastic furniture and toys. In the developing world the applications of plastic may differ of India s consumption is used in packaging. Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic. The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials but rather the meaning of the word plasticity with regard to the reshaping of flesh. The world s first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite invented in New York in by Leo Baekeland who coined the term plastics . Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger who has been called the father of polymer chemistry and Herman Mark known as the father of polymer physics . The success and dominance of plastics starting in the early th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of large molecules. Toward the end of the century one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling. The word plastic derives from the Greek plastikos meaning capable of being shaped or molded and in turn from plastos meaning molded . The plasticity or malleability of the material during manufacture allows it to be cast pressed or extruded into a variety of shapes such as films fibers plates tubes bottles boxes amongst many others. The common noun plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective plastic. The adjective is applicable to any material which undergoes a plastic deformation or permanent change of shape when strained beyond a certain point. For example aluminum which is stamped or forged exhibits plasticity in this sense but is not plastic in the common sense. By contrast some plastics will in their finished forms break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense. Most plastics contain organic polymers. The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms pure or with the addition of oxygen nitrogen or sulfur. The chains comprise many repeat units formed from monomers. Each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units. The backbone is the part of the chain that is on the main path linking together a large number of repeat units. To customize the properties of a plastic different molecular groups hang from this backbone. These pendant units are usually hung on the monomers before the monomers themselves are linked together to form the polymer chain. It is the structure of these side chains that influences the properties of the polymer. The molecular structure of the repeating unit can be fine tuned to influence specific properties of the polymer. Plastics are usually classified by the chemical structure of the polymer s backbone and side chains some important groups in these classifications are the acrylics polyesters silicones polyurethanes and halogenated plastics. Plastics can also be classified by the chemical process used in their synthesis such as condensation polyaddition and cross linking. Plastics can also be classified by their various physical properties such as hardness density tensile strength resistance to heat and glass transition temperature and by their chemical properties such as the organic chemistry of the polymer and its resistance and reaction to various chemical products and processes such as organic solvents oxidation and ionizing radiation. In particular most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees celsius. Other classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or product design. Examples of such qualities and classes are thermoplastics and thermosets conductive polymers biodegradable plastics and engineering plastics and other plastics with particular structures such as elastomers. One important classification of plastics is by the permanence or impermanence of their form or whether they are thermoplastics or thermosetting polymers. Thermoplastics are the plastics that when heated do not undergo chemical change in their composition and so can be molded again and again. Examples include polyethylene PE polypropylene PP polystyrene PS and polyvinyl chloride PVC . Common thermoplastics range from to amu while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight. Thermosets or thermosetting polymers can melt and take shape only once after they have solidified they stay solid. In the thermosetting process a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber is an example of a thermosetting process before heating with sulfur the polyisoprene is a tacky slightly runny material after vulcanization the product is rigid and non tacky. Many plastics are completely amorphous such as all thermosets polystyrene and its copolymers and polymethyl methacrylate. However some plastics are partially crystalline and partially amorphous in molecular structure giving them both a melting point the temperature at which the attractive intermolecular forces are overcome and also one or more glass transitions the temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased. These so called semi crystalline plastics include polyethylene polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polyamides nylons polyesters and some polyurethanes. Intrinsically Conducting Polymers ICP are organic polymers that conduct electricity. While plastics can be made electrically conductive with a conductivity of up to kS cm in stretch oriented polyacetylene they are still no match for most metals like copper which have a conductivity of several hundred kS cm. Nevertheless this is a developing field. Biodegradable plastics are plastics that degrade or break down upon exposure to sunlight or ultra violet radiation water or dampness bacteria enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances rodent pest or insect attack can also be considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation. Some modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface aerobic whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems anaerobic . Some companies produce biodegradable additives to enhance biodegradation. Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic. Some researchers have genetically engineered bacteria to synthesize completely biodegradable plastics such as Biopol however these are expensive at present. While most plastics are produced from petrochemicals bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials such as cellulose and starch. Due both to the finite limits of the petrochemical reserves and to the threat of global warming the development of bioplastics is a growing field. However bioplastic development begins from a very low base and as yet does not compare significantly with petrochemical production. Estimates of the global production capacity for bio derived materials is put at tonnes year. In contrast global production of polyethylene PE and polypropylene PP the world s leading petrochemical derived polyolefins was estimated at over million tonnes in . This category includes both commodity plastics or standard plastics and engineering plastics. The development of plastics has evolved from the use of natural plastic materials e.g. chewing gum shellac to the use of chemically modified natural materials e.g. natural rubber nitrocellulose collagen galalite and finally to completely synthetic molecules e.g. bakelite epoxy polyvinyl chloride . Early plastics were bio derived materials such as egg and blood proteins which are organic polymers. In around BC Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls bands and figurines. Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages. Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk proteins casein with lye. In the nineteenth century as industrial chemistry developed during the Industrial Revolution many materials were reported. The development of plastics also accelerated with Charles Goodyear s discovery of vulcanization to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber. Parkesine nitrocellulose is considered the first man made plastic. The plastic material was patented by Alexander Parkes in Birmingham England in . It was unveiled at the Great International Exhibition in London. Parkesine won a bronze medal at the World s fair in London. Parkesine was made from cellulose the major component of plant cell walls treated with nitric acid as a solvent. The output of the process commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated. By incorporating pigments into the product it could be made to resemble ivory. In the Hanover Germany mass printing press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards. The resultant horn like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist Friedrich Adolph Spitteler . The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose. In French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde producing material marketed as galalith. In the early s Bakelite the first fully synthetic thermoset was reported by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde. After World War I improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics with mass production beginning in the s and s around World War II . Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene PS first produced by BASF in the s and polyvinyl chloride PVC first created in but commercially produced in the late s. In Durite Plastics Inc. was the first manufacturer of phenol furfural resins. In polyethylene was discovered by Imperial Chemical Industries ICI researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett. In polypropylene was discovered by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in . In expanded polystyrene used for building insulation packaging and cups was invented by Dow Chemical. Polyethylene terephthalate PET s discovery is credited to employees of the Calico Printers Association in the UK in it was licensed to DuPont for the US and ICI otherwise and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe. Plastics manufacturing is a major part of the chemical industry and some of the world s largest chemical companies have been involved since the earliest days such as the industry leaders BASF and Dow Chemical. In sales of the top fifty companies amounted to US . The firms came from some eighteen countries in total with more than half of the companies on the list being headquartered in the US. Many of the top fifty plastics companies were concentrated in just three countries BASF was the world s largest chemical producer for the ninth year in a row. Trade associations which represent the industry in the US include the American Chemistry Council. Many of the properties of plastics are determined by standards specified by ISO such as Many of the properties of plastics are determined by the UL Standards tests specified by Underwriters Laboratories UL such as Blended into most plastics are additional organic or inorganic compounds. The average content of additives is a few percent. Many of the controversies associated with plastics actually relate to the additives organotin compounds are particularly toxic. Typical additives include Polymer stabilizers prolong the lifetime of the polymer by suppressing degradation that results from UV light oxidation and other phenomena. Typical stabilizers thus absorb UV light or function as antioxidants. Many plastics citation needed contain fillers to improve performance or reduce production costs. Typically fillers are mineral in origin e.g. chalk. Other fillers include starch cellulose wood flour ivory dust and zinc oxide. Plasticizers are by mass often the most abundant additives. These oily but nonvolatile compounds are blended in to plastics to improve rheology as many organic polymers are otherwise too rigid for particular applications. Colorants are another common additive though their weight contribution is small. Pure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives some of which can be toxic. For example plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging toys and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP di ethylhexyl phthalate and other phthalates in some applications and the United States has limited the use of DEHP DPB BBP DINP DIDP and DnOP in children s toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols. Whereas the finished plastic may be non toxic the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic. In some cases small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed. For example the World Health Organization s International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC has recognized vinyl chloride the precursor to PVC as a human carcinogen. Some polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated. In it was reported that almost all plastic products sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity. The primary building block of polycarbonates bisphenol A BPA is an estrogen like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food. Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals offspring. A more recent animal study suggests that even low level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance which can lead to inflammation and heart disease. As of January the LA Times newspaper reports that the United States FDA is spending million to investigate indications of BPA being linked to cancer. Bis ethylhexyl adipate present in plastic wrap based on PVC is also of concern as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell. The European Union has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys. In the United States government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic. Most plastics are durable and degrade very slowly as their chemical structure renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation. There are differing estimates of how much plastic waste has been produced in the last century. By one estimate one billion tons of plastic waste have been discarded since the s. Others estimate a cumulative human production of . billion tons of plastic of which . billion tons is waste with a recycling rate of only . Much of this material may persist for centuries or longer given the demonstrated persistence of structurally similar natural materials such as amber. The Ocean Conservancy reported that China Indonesia Philippines Thailand and Vietnam dump more plastic in the sea than all other countries combined. The rivers Yangtze Indus Yellow River Hai River Nile Ganges Pearl River Amur Niger and the Mekong transport of the global plastics load into the sea. The presence of plastics particularly microplastics within the food chain is increasing. In the s microplastics were observed in the guts of seabirds and since then have been found in increasing concentrations. The long term effects of plastic in the food chain are poorly understood. In it was estimated that of modern waste was plastic although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile of debris in marine areas is plastic. Prior to the Montreal Protocol CFCs were commonly used in the manufacture of polystyrene and as such the production of polystyrene contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer. In a new report Plastic and Climate was published. According to the report plastic wiil contribute Greenhouse gases in the equivalent of million tons of Carbon dioxide CO to the atmosphere in . In current trend annual emissions will grow to . billion tons by . By plastic could emit billion tons of Greenhouse gas emissions as much as percent of the earth s remaining carbon budget . The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated it increases carbon emissions if it is placed in a landfill it becomes a carbon sink although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions. Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal plastic may reduce energy consumption. For example packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save in transportation energy. Production of plastics from crude oil requires to MJ Kg taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of . Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming to MJ Kg of silicon and about MJ Kg of semiconductors. This is much higher than the energy needed to produce many other materials e.g. iron from iron ore requires MJ Kg of energy glass from sand etc. MJ Kg steel from iron MJ Kg paper from timber MJ Kg. Controlled high temperature incineration above C for two seconds citation needed performed with selective additional heating breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration. Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins a carcinogen cancer causing chemical . The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies. Open air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures and normally releases such toxic fumes. Plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon. Plastics contribute to approximately of discarded waste. Depending on their chemical composition plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant absorption and adsorption. Polymer degradation takes much longer as a result of saline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. These factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments. Recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought due to exposure to sun rain and other environmental conditions resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A. However due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean decomposition has slowed down. The Marine Conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products. It is estimated that a foam plastic cup will take years a plastic beverage holder will take years a disposable nappy will take years and fishing line will take years to degrade. In a survey by the Global Oceanic Environmental Survey GOES Foundation found that the ecosystem in seas and oceans may collapse in the next years potentially causing failure of terrestrial ecosystem and very possibly the end of life on Earth as we know it the main agents of this prediction were hypothesized to be plastic ocean acidification and ocean pollution. In order to prevent such a catastrophe experts have proposed a total single use plastic ban wood burning bans while planting as many trees as possible pollution free recycling of electronics and by all industries to be zero toxic discharge. One British scientist advocates special protection and perservation of peat bogs wetlands marshlands and mangrove swamps to ensure carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere. Microbial species capable of degrading plastics are known to science and some are potentially useful for the disposal of certain classes of plastic waste. Thermoplastics can be remelted and reused and thermoset plastics can be ground up and used as filler although the purity of the material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle. There are methods by which plastics can be broken down to a feedstock state. The greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes making it labor intensive. Typically workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable which presents additional problems for the sorting process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling. While containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic making them relatively easy to sort a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics. In such cases the resources it would take to separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly which may result in more product components being reused or recycled. Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well. For example polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective. These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste to energy plants. An early success in the recycling of plastics is Vinyloop an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to recycle composite PVC waste which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop based recycled PVC s primary energy demand is percent lower than conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome. This process was used after the Olympic Games in London . Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way the PVC Policy could be fulfilled which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended. In to assist recycling of disposable items the Plastic Bottle Institute of the U.S. Society of the Plastics Industry devised a now familiar scheme to mark plastic bottles by plastic type. Under this scheme a plastic container is marked with a triangle of three chasing arrows which encloses a number denoting the plastic type  The first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in by Leo Hendrik Baekeland a Belgian born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol CHOH and formaldehyde HCOH formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour asbestos or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant composite materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth uniform product as he announced in in a meeting of the American Chemical Society. Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the s. Bakelite was a purely synthetic material not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic. Unplasticised polystyrene is a rigid brittle inexpensive plastic that has been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick knacks. It also is the basis for some of the most popular foamed plastics under the name styrene foam or Styrofoam. Like most other foam plastics foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an open cell form in which the foam bubbles are interconnected as in an absorbent sponge and closed cell in which all the bubbles are distinct like tiny balloons as in gas filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late s high impact styrene was introduced which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties. Polyvinyl chloride PVC commonly called vinyl incorporates chlorine atoms. The C Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation and burning . PVC is stiff strong heat and weather resistant properties that recommend its use in devices for plumbing gutters house siding enclosures for computers and other electronics gear. PVC can also be softened with chemical processing and in this form it is now used for shrink wrap food packaging and rain gear. All PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light. When this happens hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs. Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long term archival storage of silver photographic film or paper mylar is preferable . The plastics industry was revolutionized in the s with the announcement of polyamide PA far better known by its trade name nylon. Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber introduced by DuPont Corporation at the World s Fair in New York City. In DuPont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber under the direction of Harvard chemist Wallace Carothers and chemistry department director Elmer Keiser Bolton. Carothers had been hired to perform pure research and he worked to understand the new materials molecular structure and physical properties. He took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials. His work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber which was very strong but also very flexible. The first application was for bristles for toothbrushes. However Du Pont s real target was silk particularly silk stockings. Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide . and . as well as polyesters. It took DuPont twelve years and US million to refine nylon and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture. With such a major investment it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction creating a public sensation or nylon mania . Nylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of when the US entered World War II. The production capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings or just nylons for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public engaging in another promotional campaign in that resulted in an even bigger craze triggering the so called nylon riots. Subsequently polyamides and have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds e.g. caprolactam. Nylon is a material manufactured by condensation polymerization. Nylons still remain important plastics and not just for use in fabrics. In its bulk form it is very wear resistant particularly if oil impregnated and so is used to build gears plain bearings valve seats seals and because of good heat resistance increasingly for under the hood applications in cars and other mechanical parts. Poly methyl methacrylate PMMA also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names Plexiglas Acrylite Lucite and Perspex among several others see below is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter resistant alternative to glass. The same material can be utilised as a casting resin in inks and coatings and has many other uses. Natural rubber is an elastomer an elastic hydrocarbon polymer that originally was derived from latex a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form indeed the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil . However in Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur and a few other chemicals forming cross links between polymer chains vulcanization improving elasticity and durability. In Nelson Goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form ebonite. The first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by Sergei Lebedev in . In World War II supply blockades of natural rubber from South East Asia caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber notably styrene butadiene rubber. In annual production of synthetic rubber in the U.S. was only tonnes which increased to tonnes in . In the space race and nuclear arms race Caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets. Ultimately all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.",FALSE

The latter is called water reclamation because treated wastewater can then be used for other purposes. The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant WWTP often referred to as a Water Resource Recovery Facility WRRF or a sewage treatment plant. Pollutants in municipal wastewater households and small industries are removed or broken down. The treatment of wastewater is part of the overarching field of sanitation. Sanitation also includes the management of human waste and solid waste as well as stormwater drainage management. By products from wastewater treatment plants such as screenings grit and sewage sludge may also be treated in a wastewater treatment plant. Ch. Although disposal or reuse occurs after treatment it must be considered first. Since disposal or reuse are the objectives of wastewater treatment disposal or reuse options are the basis for treatment decisions. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary with the type of use or location of disposal. Transportation costs often make acceptable impurity concentrations dependent upon location of disposal but expensive treatment requirements may encourage selection of a disposal location on the basis of impurity concentrations. Ocean disposal is subject to international treaty requirements. International treaties may also regulate disposal into rivers crossing international borders. Water bodies entirely within the jurisdiction of a single nation may be subject to regulations of multiple local governments. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary widely among different jurisdictions for disposal of wastewater to evaporation ponds infiltration basins or injection wells. Biological processes can be employed in the treatment of wastewater and these processes may include for example aerated lagoons activated sludge or slow sand filters. To be effective sewage must be conveyed to a treatment plant by appropriate pipes and infrastructure and the process itself must be subject to regulation and controls. Some wastewaters require different and sometimes specialized treatment methods. At the simplest level treatment of sewage and most wastewaters is carried out through separation of solids from liquids usually by sedimentation. By progressively converting dissolved material into solids usually a biological floc which is then settled out an effluent stream of increasing purity is produced. Phase separation transfers impurities into a non aqueous phase. Phase separation may occur at intermediate points in a treatment sequence to remove solids generated during oxidation or polishing. Grease and oil may be recovered for fuel or saponification. Solids often require dewatering of sludge in a wastewater treatment plant. Disposal options for dried solids vary with the type and concentration of impurities removed from water. Production of waste brine however may discourage wastewater treatment removing dissolved inorganic solids from water by methods like ion exchange reverse osmosis and distillation. Solids like stones grit and sand may be removed from wastewater by gravity when density differences are sufficient to overcome dispersion by turbulence. Gravity separation of solids is the primary treatment of sewage where the unit process is called primary settling tanks or primary sedimentation tanks . It is also widely used for the treatment of other wastewaters. Solids that are heavier than water will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent settling basins. More complex clarifiers also have skimmers to simultaneously remove floating grease like soap scum and solids like feathers or wood chips. Containers like the API oil water separator are specifically designed to separate non polar liquids. Suspended solids and colloidal suspensions of fine solids may generally following some form of coagulation be removed by filtration through fine physical barriers distinguished from coarser screens or sieves by the ability to remove particles smaller than the openings through which the water passes. Other types of water filters remove impurities by chemical or biological processes described below. Oxidation reduces the biochemical oxygen demand of wastewater and may reduce the toxicity of some impurities. Secondary treatment converts organic compounds into carbon dioxide water and biosolids. Chemical oxidation is widely used for disinfection. Secondary treatment by biochemical oxidation of dissolved and colloidal organic compounds is widely used in sewage treatment and is applicable to some agricultural and industrial wastewaters. Biological oxidation will preferentially remove organic compounds useful as a food supply for the treatment ecosystem. Concentration of some less digestible compounds may be reduced by co metabolism. Removal efficiency is limited by the minimum food concentration required to sustain the treatment ecosystem. Chemical including Electrochemical oxidation is used to remove some persistent organic pollutants and concentrations remaining after biochemical oxidation. Disinfection by chemical oxidation kills bacteria and microbial pathogens by adding ozone chlorine or hypochlorite to wastewater. Polishing refers to treatments made following the above methods. These treatments may also be used independently for some industrial wastewater. Chemical reduction or pH adjustment minimizes chemical reactivity of wastewater following chemical oxidation. Carbon filtering removes remaining contaminants and impurities by chemical absorption onto activated carbon. Filtration through sand calcium carbonate or fabric filters is the most common method used in municipal wastewater treatment. Wastewater treatment plants may be distinguished by the type of wastewater to be treated i.e. whether it is sewage industrial wastewater agricultural wastewater or leachate. A typical municipal sewage treatment plant in an industrialized country may include primary treatment to remove solid material secondary treatment to digest dissolved and suspended organic material as well as the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and sometimes but not always disinfection to kill pathogenic bacteria. The sewage sludge that is produced in sewage treatment plants undergoes sludge treatment. Larger municipalities often include factories discharging industrial wastewater into the municipal sewer system. The term sewage treatment plant is now often replaced with the term wastewater treatment plant . Sewage can also be treated by processes using Nature based solutions . Tertiary treatment is a term applied to polishing methods used following a traditional sewage treatment sequence. Tertiary treatment is being increasingly applied in industrialized countries and most common technologies are micro filtration or synthetic membranes. After membrane filtration the treated wastewater is nearly indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality without its minerals . Nitrates can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but also via microbial denitrification. Ozone wastewater treatment is also growing in popularity and requires the use of an ozone generator which decontaminates the water as ozone bubbles percolate through the tank. The latest and very promising treatment technology is the use aerobic granulation. Disposal of wastewaters from an industrial plant is a difficult and costly problem. Most petroleum refineries chemical and petrochemical plants have onsite facilities to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the local and or national regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into community treatment plants or into rivers lakes or oceans. Constructed wetlands are being used in an increasing number of cases as they provided high quality and productive on site treatment. Other industrial processes that produce a lot of waste waters such as paper and pulp production has created environmental concern leading to development of processes to recycle water use within plants before they have to be cleaned and disposed. Industrial wastewater treatment plants are required where municipal sewage treatment plants are unavailable or cannot adequately treat specific industrial wastewaters. Industrial wastewater plants may reduce raw water costs by converting selected wastewaters to reclaimed water used for different purposes. Industrial wastewater treatment plants may reduce wastewater treatment charges collected by municipal sewage treatment plants by pre treating wastewaters to reduce concentrations of pollutants measured to determine user fees. Although economies of scale may favor use of a large municipal sewage treatment plant for disposal of small volumes of industrial wastewater industrial wastewater treatment and disposal may be less expensive than correctly apportioned costs for larger volumes of industrial wastewater not requiring the conventional sewage treatment sequence of a small municipal sewage treatment plant. An industrial wastewater treatment plant may include one or more of the following rather than the conventional primary secondary and disinfection sequence of sewage treatment Agricultural wastewater treatment for continuous confined animal operations like milk and egg production may be performed in plants using mechanized treatment units similar to those described under industrial wastewater but where land is available for ponds settling basins and facultative lagoons may have lower operational costs for seasonal use conditions from breeding or harvest cycles. Leachate treatment plants are used to treat leachate from landfills. Treatment options include biological treatment mechanical treatment by ultrafiltration treatment with active carbon filters electrochemical treatment including electrocoagulation by various proprietary technologies and reverse osmosis membrane filtration using disc tube module technology. The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA and state environmental agencies set wastewater standards under the Clean Water Act. Point sources must obtain surface water discharge permits through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES . Point sources include industrial facilities municipal governments sewage treatment plants and storm sewer systems other government facilities such as military bases and some agricultural facilities such as animal feedlots. EPA sets basic national wastewater standards These standards are incorporated into the permits which may include additional treatment requirements for individual plants developed on a case by case basis. NPDES permits must be renewed every five years. EPA has authorized state agencies to issue and enforce NPDES permits. EPA regional offices issue permits for the rest of the country. Wastewater discharges to groundwater are regulated by the Underground Injection Control Program UIC under the Safe Drinking Water Act. UIC permits are issued by state agencies and EPA regional offices.

"60",60,"aluminium","/wiki/Aluminium",TRUE,0,"chemical|","Aluminium aluminum in American and Canadian English is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number"," Aluminium aluminum in American and Canadian English is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number . It is a silvery white soft non magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group. By mass aluminium makes up about of the Earth s crust it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust though it is less common in the mantle below. The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments. Instead it is found combined in over different minerals. Aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation. Aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries such as building facades and window frames. The oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium. Despite its prevalence in the environment no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of these salts abundance the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest and studies continue. Of aluminium isotopes only Al is stable. This is consistent with aluminium having an odd atomic number. a It is the only aluminium isotope that has existed on Earth in its current form since the creation of the planet. Very nearly all the element on Earth is present as this isotope which makes aluminium a mononuclidic element and means that its standard atomic weight practically equates to that of the isotope. The standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals b which has consequences for the element s properties see below . All other isotopes of aluminium are radioactive. The most stable of these is Al half life years and therefore could not have survived since the formation of the planet. However Al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic ray protons. The ratio of Al to Be has been used for radiodating of geological processes over to year time scales in particular transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of Al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation . billion years ago. The remaining isotopes of aluminium with mass numbers ranging from to all have half lives well under an hour. Three metastable states are known all with half lives under a minute. An aluminium atom has electrons arranged in an electron configuration of Ne sp with three electrons beyond a stable noble gas configuration. Accordingly the combined first three ionization energies of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone. Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions see below . The electronegativity of aluminium is . Pauling scale . A free aluminium atom has a radius of pm. With the three outermost electrons removed the radius shrinks to pm for a coordinated atom or . pm for a coordinated atom. At standard temperature and pressure aluminium atoms when not affected by atoms of other elements form a face centered cubic crystal system bound by metallic bonding provided by atoms outermost electrons hence aluminium at these conditions is a metal. This crystal system is shared by some other metals such as lead and copper the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those other metals. Aluminium metal has an appearance ranging from silvery white to dull gray depending on the surface roughness. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector approximately of visible light and an excellent reflector as much as of medium and far infrared radiation. The density of aluminium is . g cm about that of steel much lower than other commonly encountered metals making aluminium parts easily identifiable through their lightness. c Aluminium is not as strong or stiff as steel but the low density makes up for this in the aerospace industry and for many other applications where light weight is crucial. Pure aluminium is quite soft and lacking in strength. In most applications various aluminium alloys are used instead because of their higher strength and hardness. The yield strength of pure aluminium is MPa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from MPa to MPa. Aluminium is ductile and malleable allowing it to be easily drawn and extruded. It is also easily machined and the low melting temperature of C allows for easy casting. Aluminium is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor having the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only of copper s density. Aluminium is capable of superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature of . kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about gauss milliteslas . It is paramagnetic and thus essentially unaffected by static magnetic fields. The high electrical conductivity however means that it is strongly affected by changing magnetic field through the induction of eddy currents.  Aluminium s corrosion resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the bare metal is exposed to air effectively preventing further oxidation in a process termed passivation. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper. This corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals. In highly acidic solutions aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen and in highly alkaline ones to form aluminates protective passivation under these conditions is negligible. Primarily because it is corroded by dissolved chlorides such as common sodium chloride household plumbing is never made from aluminium. However because of its general resistance to corrosion aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver colored paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the nm UV and the nm far IR regions in the nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by tin and silver and in the nm near IR by silver gold and copper. Aluminium is oxidized by water at temperatures below C to produce hydrogen aluminium hydroxide and heat This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. However commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer which inhibits the reaction and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal. The vast majority of compounds including all Al containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds feature aluminium in the oxidation state . The coordination number of such compounds varies but generally Al is six coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium III are colorless. All four trihalides are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride AlF features six coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF is related to the compactness of the fluoride ion six of which can fit around the small Al center. AlF sublimes with cracking at C F . With heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen although other methods exist. Acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates. In aqueous solution the halides often form mixtures generally containing six coordinate Al centers that feature both halide and aquo ligands. When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution they readily form complex ions such as AlF HO AlF HO and AlF . In the case of chloride polyaluminium clusters are formed such as AlO OH HO . Aluminium forms one stable oxide with the chemical formula AlO. It can be found in nature in the mineral corundum. Aluminium oxide is also commonly called alumina. Sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide hydroxides AlO OH are boehmite and diaspore. There are three trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure polymorphs . Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful. Aluminium carbide AlC is made by heating a mixture of the elements above C F . The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane. The acetylide Al C is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium. Aluminium nitride AlN is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral Al centers. It can be made from the elements at C F . It is air stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity. Aluminium phosphide AlP is made similarly it hydrolyses to give phosphine Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al centers compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al species. AlF AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition AlI is unstable at room temperature converting to triiodide A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine AlI NEt . Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are AlO and AlS. AlO is made by heating the normal oxide AlO with silicon at C F in a vacuum. Such materials quickly disproportionate to the starting materials. Very simple Al II compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of Al metal with oxidants. For example aluminium monoxide AlO has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra. More thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula RAl which contain an Al Al bond and where R is a large organic ligand. A variety of compounds of empirical formula AlR and AlR.Cl. exist. These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centers formed by dimerization with some R or Cl bridging between both Al atoms e.g. trimethylaluminium has the formula Al CH see figure . With large organic groups triorganoaluminium compounds exist as three coordinate monomers such as triisobutylaluminium. Such compounds which are widely used in industrial chemistry despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric. Few analogues exist between organoaluminium and organoboron compounds other than clarification needed large organic groups. The industrially important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride LiAlH which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry. It can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride Several useful derivatives of LiAlH are known e.g. sodium bis methoxyethoxy dihydridoaluminate. The simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula AlH n in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula BH . Aluminium s per particle abundance in the Solar System is . ppm parts per million . d It is the twelfth most abundant of all elements and third most abundant among the elements that have odd atomic numbers after hydrogen and nitrogen. The only stable isotope of aluminium Al is the eighteenth most abundant nucleus in the Universe. It is created almost entirely after fusion of carbon in massive stars that will later become Type II supernovae this fusion creates Mg which upon capturing free protons and neutrons becomes aluminium. Some smaller quantities of Al are created in hydrogen burning shells of evolved stars where Mg can capture free protons. Essentially all aluminium now in existence is Al Al was present in the early Solar System but is currently extinct. However the trace quantities of Al that do exist are the most common gamma ray emitter in the interstellar gas. Overall the Earth is about . aluminium by mass seventh in abundance by mass . Aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the Earth than in the Universe because aluminium easily forms the oxide and becomes bound into rocks and aluminium stays in the Earth s crust while less reactive metals sink to the core. In the Earth s crust aluminium is the most abundant . by mass metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements after oxygen and silicon . A large number of silicates in the Earth s crust contain aluminium. In contrast the Earth s mantle is only . aluminium by mass. Because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates. Feldspars the most common group of minerals in the Earth s crust are aluminosilicates. Aluminium also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise. Impurities in AlO such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively. Native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes. Native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the South China Sea. It is possible that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of tetrahydroxoaluminate Al OH . Although aluminium is a common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite AlOx OH x . Bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions. In most bauxite was mined in Australia China Guinea and India. The history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum. The first written record of alum made by Greek historian Herodotus dates back to the th century BCE. The ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing mordant and for city defense. After the Crusades alum an indispensable good in the European fabric industry was a subject of international commerce it was imported to Europe from the eastern Mediterranean until the mid th century. The nature of alum remained unknown. Around Swiss physician Paracelsus suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum. In German doctor and chemist Andreas Libavius experimentally confirmed this In German chemist Friedrich Hoffmann announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth. In German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash. Attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to . The first successful attempt however was completed in by Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian rsted. He reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin. He presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in . In German chemist Friedrich Whler repeated rsted s experiments but did not identify any aluminium. The reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in . He conducted a similar experiment in the same year by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium. In he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal. For many years thereafter Whler was credited as the discoverer of aluminium. As Whler s method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold. The first industrial production of aluminium was established in by French chemist Henri Etienne Sainte Claire Deville and companions. Deville had discovered that aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which Whler had used. Even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample. The first industrial large scale production method was independently developed in by French engineer Paul Hroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall it is now known as the Hall Hroult process. The Hall Hroult process converts alumina into the metal. Austrian chemist Carl Joseph Bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the Bayer process in . Modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the Bayer and Hall Hroult processes. Prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry everyday items eyeglass frames optical instruments tableware and foil in the s and early th century. Aluminium s ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses at the time. During World War I major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes. By the mid th century aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares. During the mid th century aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work and increasingly being used in military engineering for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines. Earth s first artificial satellite launched in consisted of two separate aluminium semi spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have used aluminium to some extent. The aluminium can was invented in and employed as a storage for drinks in . Throughout the th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in was metric tons the annual production first exceeded metric tons in tons in tons in . In the s the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the London Metal Exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in . The output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded metric tons in . The real price for aluminium declined from per metric ton in to in in United States dollars . Extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies. However the need to exploit lower grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs above all energy increased the net cost of aluminium the real price began to grow in the s with the rise of energy cost. Production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper. Production costs in the late th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the United States dollar and alumina prices. The BRIC countries combined share grew in the first decade of the st century from . to . in primary production and . to . in primary consumption. China is accumulating an especially large share of world s production thanks to abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli it also increased its consumption share from in to in . In the United States Western Europe and Japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging. Aluminium is named after alumina or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature. The word alumina comes from alum the mineral from which it was collected. The word alum comes from alumen a Latin word meaning bitter salt . The word alumen stems from the Proto Indo European root alu meaning bitter or beer . British chemist Humphry Davy who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal is credited as the person who named the element. In he suggested the metal be named alumium. This suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from France Germany and Sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated. In Davy chose aluminum thus producing the modern name. However its spelling and pronunciation varies aluminum is in use in the United States and Canada while aluminium is in use elsewhere. The ium suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium all of which Davy isolated himself . Nevertheless element names ending in um were known at the time for example platinum known to Europeans since the th century molybdenum discovered in and tantalum discovered in . The um suffix is consistent with the universal spelling alumina for the oxide as opposed to aluminia compare to lanthana the oxide of lanthanum and magnesia ceria and thoria the oxides of magnesium cerium and thorium respectively. In British scientist Thomas Young wrote an anonymous review of Davy s book in which he objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminum which has a less classical sound. This name did catch on while the um spelling was occasionally used in Britain the American scientific language used ium from the start. Most scientists used ium throughout the world in the th century it still remains the standard in most other languages. In American lexicographer Noah Webster used exclusively the aluminum spelling in his American Dictionary of the English Language. In the s the um spelling started to gain usage in the United States by the s it had become the more common spelling there outside science. In Hall used the um spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the ium spelling in all the patents he filed between and . It was subsequently suggested this was a typo rather than intended. By both spellings had been common in the U.S. overall the ium spelling being slightly more common by the situation had reversed by aluminum had become twice as common as aluminium during the following decade the um spelling dominated American usage. In the American Chemical Society adopted this spelling. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in . In they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant the same is true for the most recent edition of the IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry. IUPAC official publications use the ium spelling as primary but list both where appropriate. e Aluminium production is highly energy consuming and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive. As of the world s largest smelters of aluminium are located in China Russia Bahrain United Arab Emirates and South Africa. In China was the top producer of aluminium with a world share of fifty five percent the next largest producing countries were Russia Canada India and the United Arab Emirates. According to the International Resource Panel s Metal Stocks in Society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society i.e. in cars buildings electronics etc. is kg lb . Much of this is in more developed countries kg lb per capita rather than less developed countries kg lb per capita . Bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide by the Bayer process. Bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground. The resulting slurry is mixed with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into a relatively insoluble compounds After this reaction the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point. It is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced. The bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded. The solution free of solids is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide this causes decomposition of the Al OH ions to aluminium hydroxide. After about half of aluminium has precipitated the mixture is sent to classifiers. Small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents coarse particles are converted to aluminium oxide by heating excess solution is removed by evaporation if needed purified and recycled. The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the Hall Hroult process. In this energy intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten and C and F mixture of cryolite NaAlF with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium. The liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing. Anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion and either bake at the process or are prebaked. The former also called Sderberg anodes are less power efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power energy and labor to prebake the cathodes. Carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash. Despite carbon s resistivity against corrosion it is still consumed at a rate of . . kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. Cathodes are made of anthracite high purity for them is not required because impurities leach only very slowly. Cathode is consumed at a rate of . . kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. A cell is usually a terminated after years following a failure of the cathode. The Hall Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above . Further purification can be done by the Hoopes process. This process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of . . Electric power represents about to of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly of electricity generated in the United States. Because of this alternatives to the Hall Hroult process have been researched but none has turned out to be economically feasible. Recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low profile activity until the late s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness. Recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part up to of the input material is lost as dross ash like oxide . An aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below . White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially. The process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material. This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases including among others hydrogen acetylene and ammonia which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties the waste is used as a filler in asphalt and concrete. Aluminium is the most widely used non ferrous metal. The global production of aluminium in was . million metric tons. It exceeded that of any other metal except iron million metric tons . Aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered. For example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of to aluminium. The main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon e.g. duralumin with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight. The major uses for aluminium metal are in The great majority about of aluminium oxide is converted to metallic aluminium. Being a very hard material Mohs hardness alumina is widely used as an abrasive being extraordinarily chemically inert it is useful in highly reactive environments such as high pressure sodium lamps. Aluminium oxide is commonly used as a catalyst for industrial processes e.g. the Claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and to alkylate amines. Many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive catalyst material is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina. Another principal use is as a drying agent or absorbent. Several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application. Aluminium sulfate in its hydrate form is produced on the annual scale of several millions of metric tons. About two thirds is consumed in water treatment. The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a mordant in dyeing in pickling seeds deodorizing of mineral oils in leather tanning and in production of other aluminium compounds. Two kinds of alum ammonium alum and potassium alum were formerly used as mordants and in leather tanning but their use has significantly declined following availability of high purity aluminium sulfate. Anhydrous aluminium chloride is used as a catalyst in chemical and petrochemical industries the dyeing industry and in synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds. Aluminium hydroxychlorides are used in purifying water in the paper industry and as antiperspirants. Sodium aluminate is used in treating water and as an accelerator of solidification of cement. Many aluminium compounds have niche applications for example Despite its widespread occurrence in the Earth s crust aluminium has no known function in biology. Aluminium salts are remarkably nontoxic aluminium sulfate having an LD of mg kg oral mouse which corresponds to grams for an kg lb person. In most people aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals. Aluminium is classified as a non carcinogen by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. There is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult and there is evidence of no toxicity if it is consumed in amounts not greater than mg day per kg of body mass. Most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces most of the small part of it that enters the bloodstream will be excreted via urine. Aluminium that does stay in the body is accumulated in above all bone and apart from that in brain liver and kidney. Aluminium metal cannot pass the blood brain barrier and natural filters before the brain but some compounds such as the fluoride can. Aluminium although rarely can cause vitamin D resistant osteomalacia erythropoietin resistant microcytic anemia and central nervous system alterations. People with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk. Chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates for excess gastric acidity control may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals such as iron or zinc sufficiently high doses g day can cause anemia. Since aluminium is excreted by kidneys their function may be impaired by toxic amounts of aluminium. An accident in England revealed that millimolar quantities of aluminium in drinking water cause significant cognitive deficits. Orally ingested aluminium salts can deposit in the brain. There is research on correlation between neurological disorders including Alzheimer s disease f and aluminium levels but it has been inconclusive so far. Aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory. In very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood brain barrier. A small percentage of people have contact allergies to aluminium and experience itchy red rashes headache muscle pain joint pain poor memory insomnia depression asthma irritable bowel syndrome or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium. Exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis. Fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard. Food is the main source of aluminium. Drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food however aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water. Major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food due to its use in food additives food and beverage packaging and cooking utensils drinking water due to its use in municipal water treatment and aluminium containing medications particularly antacid antiulcer and buffered aspirin formulations . Dietary exposure in Europeans averages to . . mg kg week but can be as high as . mg kg week. Higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to miners aluminium production workers and dialysis patients. Excessive consumption of antacids antiperspirants vaccines and cosmetics provide significant exposure levels. Consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues. In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium the only treatment is deferoxamine mesylate which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation. However this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels but also those of other metals such as copper or iron. Nutritionally treatment of similar to those of other toxic metals and includes removal of sources of aluminium from environment enhancing cellular energy production enhancing activity of the eliminative organs and chelating aluminium with nutrients. High levels of aluminium occur near mining sites small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal fired power plants or incinerators. Aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time. Acidic precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium however the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air. In water aluminium acts as a toxi agent on gill breathing animals such as fish by causing loss of plasma and hemolymph ions leading to osmoregulatory failure. Organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with metabolism in mammals and birds even though this rarely happens in practice. Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils. Although it is generally harmless to plant growth in pH neutral soils in acid soils the concentration of toxic Al cations increases and disturbs root growth and function. Wheat has developed a tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations. Sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. Aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process. The major challenge is the greenhouse gas emissions. These gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing. The most potent of these gases are perfluorocarbons from the smelting process. Released sulfur dioxide is one of the primary precursors of acid rain. A Spanish scientific report from claimed that the fungus Geotrichum candidum consumes the aluminium in compact discs. Other reports all refer back to that report and there is no supporting original research. Better documented the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus Cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene based fuels not avgas and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium. However these life forms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium rather the metal is corroded by microbe waste products.",FALSE

"62",62,"cement","/wiki/Cement",TRUE,0,"material|material|","A cement is a binder a substance used for construction that sets hardens and adheres to other materials to bind them together"," A cement is a binder a substance used for construction that sets hardens and adheres to other materials to bind them together. There are two main forms of cement Geopolymer cement and Portland Cement. Cement is seldom used on its own but rather to bind sand and gravel aggregate together. Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry or with sand and gravel produces concrete. Cement is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet s most consumed resource. Cements used in construction are usually inorganic often lime or calcium silicate based and can be characterized as either hydraulic or non hydraulic depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water see hydraulic and non hydraulic lime plaster . Non hydraulic cement does not set in wet conditions or under water. Rather it sets as it dries and reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. It is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting. Hydraulic cements e.g. Portland cement set and become adhesive due to a chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water. The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack. This allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack. The chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient Romans used volcanic ash pozzolana with added lime calcium oxide . The word cement can be traced back to the Roman term opus caementicium used to describe masonry resembling modern concrete that was made from crushed rock with burnt lime as binder. The volcanic ash and pulverized brick supplements that were added to the burnt lime to obtain a hydraulic binder were later referred to as cementum cimentum cment and cement. In modern times organic polymers are sometimes used as cements in concrete. Cement materials can be classified into two distinct categories non hydraulic cements and hydraulic cements according to their respective setting and hardening mechanisms. Hydraulic cements setting and hardening involve hydration reactions and therefore require water while non hydraulic cements only react with a gas and can directly set under air. Non hydraulic cement such as slaked lime calcium oxide mixed with water hardens by carbonation in contact with carbon dioxide which is present in the air vol. ppm . vol. . First calcium oxide lime is produced from calcium carbonate limestone or chalk by calcination at temperatures above C F for about hours at atmospheric pressure The calcium oxide is then spent slaked mixing it with water to make slaked lime calcium hydroxide Once the excess water is completely evaporated this process is technically called setting the carbonation starts This reaction takes time because the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air is low . millibar . The carbonation reaction requires that the dry cement be exposed to air so the slaked lime is a non hydraulic cement and cannot be used under water. This process is called the lime cycle. Conversely hydraulic cement hardens by hydration of the clinker minerals when water is added. Hydraulic cements such as Portland cement are made of a mixture of silicates and oxides the four main mineral phases of the clinker abbreviated in the cement chemist notation being The silicates are responsible for the cement s mechanical properties the tricalcium aluminate and brownmillerite are essential for the formation of the liquid phase during the sintering firing process of clinker at high temperature in the kiln. The chemistry of these reactions is not completely clear and is still the object of research. Perhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement is from twelve million years ago. A deposit of cement was formed after an occurrence of oil shale located adjacent to a bed of limestone burned due to natural causes. These ancient deposits were investigated in the s and s. Cement chemically speaking is a product that includes lime as the primary curing ingredient but is far from the first material used for cementation. The Babylonians and Assyrians used bitumen to bind together burnt brick or alabaster slabs. In Egypt stone blocks were cemented together with a mortar made of sand and roughly burnt gypsum CaSO HO which often contained calcium carbonate CaCO . Lime calcium oxide was used on Crete and by the ancient Greeks. There is evidence that the Minoans of Crete used crushed potshards as an artificial pozzolan for hydraulic cement. Nobody knows who first discovered that a combination of hydrated non hydraulic lime and a pozzolan produces a hydraulic mixture see also Pozzolanic reaction but such concrete was used by the Ancient Macedonians and three centuries later on a large scale by Roman engineers. There is... a kind of powder which from natural causes produces astonishing results. It is found in the neighborhood of Baiae and in the country belonging to the towns round about Mt. Vesuvius. This substance when mixed with lime and rubble not only lends strength to buildings of other kinds but even when piers of it are constructed in the sea they set hard under water. The Greeks used volcanic tuff from the island of Thera as their pozzolan and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash activated aluminium silicates with lime. This mixture could set under water increasing its resistance. clarification needed The material was called pozzolana from the town of Pozzuoli west of Naples where volcanic ash was extracted. In the absence of pozzolanic ash the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes many of which still stand. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement. Roman concrete was rarely used on the outside of buildings. The normal technique was to use brick facing material as the formwork for an infill of mortar mixed with an aggregate of broken pieces of stone brick potsherds recycled chunks of concrete or other building rubble. Any preservation of this knowledge in literature from the Middle Ages is unknown but medieval masons and some military engineers actively used hydraulic cement in structures such as canals fortresses harbors and shipbuilding facilities. A mixture of lime mortar and aggregate with brick or stone facing material was used in the Eastern Roman Empire as well as in the West into the Gothic period. The German Rhineland continued to use hydraulic mortar throughout the Middle Ages having local pozzolana deposits called trass. Tabby is a building material made from oyster shell lime sand and whole oyster shells to form a concrete. The Spanish introduced it to the Americas in the sixteenth century. The technical knowledge for making hydraulic cement was formalized by French and British engineers in the th century. John Smeaton made an important contribution to the development of cements while planning the construction of the third Eddystone Lighthouse in the English Channel now known as Smeaton s Tower. He needed a hydraulic mortar that would set and develop some strength in the twelve hour period between successive high tides. He performed experiments with combinations of different limestones and additives including trass and pozzolanas and did exhaustive market research on the available hydraulic limes visiting their production sites and noted that the hydraulicity of the lime was directly related to the clay content of the limestone used to make it. Smeaton was a civil engineer by profession and took the idea no further. In the South Atlantic seaboard of the United States tabby relying on the oyster shell middens of earlier Native American populations was used in house construction from the s to the s. In Britain particularly good quality building stone became ever more expensive during a period of rapid growth and it became a common practice to construct prestige buildings from the new industrial bricks and to finish them with a stucco to imitate stone. Hydraulic limes were favored for this but the need for a fast set time encouraged the development of new cements. Most famous was Parker s Roman cement . This was developed by James Parker in the s and finally patented in . It was in fact nothing like material used by the Romans but was a natural cement made by burning septaria nodules that are found in certain clay deposits and that contain both clay minerals and calcium carbonate. The burnt nodules were ground to a fine powder. This product made into a mortar with sand set in minutes. The success of Roman cement led other manufacturers to develop rival products by burning artificial hydraulic lime cements of clay and chalk. Roman cement quickly became popular but was largely replaced by Portland cement in the s. Apparently unaware of Smeaton s work the same principle was identified by Frenchman Louis Vicat in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Vicat went on to devise a method of combining chalk and clay into an intimate mixture and burning this produced an artificial cement in considered the principal forerunner of Portland cement and ...Edgar Dobbs of Southwark patented a cement of this kind in . In Russia Egor Cheliev created a new binder by mixing lime and clay. His results were published in in his book A Treatise on the Art to Prepare a Good Mortar published in St. Petersburg. A few years later in he published another book which described various methods of making cement and concrete and the benefits of cement in the construction of buildings and embankments. Portland cement the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete mortar stucco and non speciality grout was developed in England in the mid th century and usually originates from limestone. James Frost produced what he called British cement in a similar manner around the same time but did not obtain a patent until . In Joseph Aspdin patented a similar material which he called Portland cement because the render made from it was in color similar to the prestigious Portland stone quarried on the Isle of Portland Dorset England. However Aspdins cement was nothing like modern Portland cement but was a first step in its development called a proto Portland cement. Joseph Aspdins son William Aspdin had left his father s company and in his cement manufacturing apparently accidentally produced calcium silicates in the s a middle step in the development of Portland cement. William Aspdin s innovation was counterintuitive for manufacturers of artificial cements because they required more lime in the mix a problem for his father a much higher kiln temperature and therefore more fuel and the resulting clinker was very hard and rapidly wore down the millstones which were the only available grinding technology of the time. Manufacturing costs were therefore considerably higher but the product set reasonably slowly and developed strength quickly thus opening up a market for use in concrete. The use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from onward and was soon the dominant use for cements. Thus Portland cement began its predominant role. Isaac Charles Johnson further refined the production of meso Portland cement middle stage of development and claimed he was the real father of Portland cement. Setting time and early strength are important characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes natural cements and artificial cements all rely on their belite content for strength development. Belite develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below C F they contained no alite which is responsible for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early s This was what we call today modern Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product others e.g. Vicat and Johnson have claimed precedence in this invention but recent analysis of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin s product made at Northfleet Kent was a true alite based cement. However Aspdin s methods were rule of thumb Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements and Johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln. In the US the first large scale use of cement was Rosendale cement a natural cement mined from a massive deposit of a large dolomite deposit discovered in the early th century near Rosendale New York. Rosendale cement was extremely popular for the foundation of buildings e.g. Statue of Liberty Capitol Building Brooklyn Bridge and lining water pipes. Sorel cement was patented in by Frenchman Stanislas Sorel. It was stronger than Portland cement but its poor water resistance and corrosive qualities limited its use in building construction. The next development in the manufacture of Portland cement was the introduction of the rotary kiln which produced a stronger more homogeneous mixture and facilitated a continuous manufacturing process. Calcium aluminate cements were patented in in France by Jules Bied for better resistance to sulfates. In the US after World War One the long curing time of at least a month for Rosendale cement made it unpopular for constructing highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement by the end of the s only one of the Rosendale cement companies had survived. But in the early s builders discovered that while Portland cement set faster it was not as durable especially for highways to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait an engineer whose company had helped construct the New York City s Catskill Aqueduct was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and Portland cements that had the good attributes of both. It was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz New York using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of Portland cement. It was a success and for decades the Rosendale Portland cement blend was used in highway and bridge construction. . Cementitious materials are used as nuclear waste immobilizing matrix for more than half century. Technologies of waste cementation have been developed and deployed at industrial scale in many countries. Cementitious wasteforms require a careful selection and design process adapted to each specific type of waste to satisfy the strict waste acceptance criteria for long term storage and disposal. Modern hydraulic development began with the start of the Industrial Revolution around driven by three main needs Modern cements are often Portland cement or Portland cement blends but industry also uses other cements. Portland cement is by far the most common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating limestone calcium carbonate with other materials such as clay to C F in a kiln in a process known as calcination that liberates a molecule of carbon dioxide from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide or quicklime which then chemically combines with the other materials in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance called clinker is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make ordinary Portland cement the most commonly used type of cement often referred to as OPC . Portland cement is a basic ingredient of concrete mortar and most non specialty grout. The most common use for Portland cement is to make concrete. Concrete is a composite material made of aggregate gravel and sand cement and water. As a construction material concrete can be cast in almost any shape and once it hardens can be a structural load bearing element. Portland cement may be grey or white. Portland cement blends are often available as inter ground mixtures from cement producers but similar formulations are often also mixed from the ground components at the concrete mixing plant. Portland blast furnace slag cement or Blast furnace cement ASTM C and EN nomenclature respectively contains up to ground granulated blast furnace slag with the rest Portland clinker and a little gypsum. All compositions produce high ultimate strength but as slag content is increased early strength is reduced while sulfate resistance increases and heat evolution diminishes. Used as an economic alternative to Portland sulfate resisting and low heat cements. Portland fly ash cement contains up to fly ash under ASTM standards ASTM C or under EN standards EN . The fly ash is pozzolanic so that ultimate strength is maintained. Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content early strength can also be maintained. Where good quality cheap fly ash is available this can be an economic alternative to ordinary Portland cement. Portland pozzolan cement includes fly ash cement since fly ash is a pozzolan but also includes cements made from other natural or artificial pozzolans. In countries where volcanic ashes are available e.g. Italy Chile Mexico the Philippines these cements are often the most common form in use. The maximum replacement ratios are generally defined as for Portland fly ash cement. Portland silica fume cement. Addition of silica fume can yield exceptionally high strengths and cements containing silica fume are occasionally produced with being the maximum allowed addition under EN . However silica fume is more usually added to Portland cement at the concrete mixer. Masonry cements are used for preparing bricklaying mortars and stuccos and must not be used in concrete. They are usually complex proprietary formulations containing Portland clinker and a number of other ingredients that may include limestone hydrated lime air entrainers retarders waterproofers and coloring agents. They are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent masonry work. Subtle variations of Masonry cement in the US are Plastic Cements and Stucco Cements. These are designed to produce a controlled bond with masonry blocks. Expansive cements contain in addition to Portland clinker expansive clinkers usually sulfoaluminate clinkers and are designed to offset the effects of drying shrinkage normally encountered in hydraulic cements. This cement can make concrete for floor slabs up to m square without contraction joints. White blended cements may be made using white clinker containing little or no iron and white supplementary materials such as high purity metakaolin. Colored cements serve decorative purposes. Some standards allow the addition of pigments to produce colored Portland cement. Other standards e.g. ASTM don t allow pigments in Portland cement and colored cements are sold as blended hydraulic cements. Very finely ground cements are cement mixed with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals that are extremely finely ground together. Such cements can have the same physical characteristics as normal cement but with less cement particularly due to their increased surface area for the chemical reaction. Even with intensive grinding they can use up to less energy and thus less carbon emissions to fabricate than ordinary Portland cements. Pozzolan lime cements are mixtures of ground pozzolan and lime. These are the cements the Romans used and are present in surviving Roman structures like the Pantheon in Rome. They develop strength slowly but their ultimate strength can be very high. The hydration products that produce strength are essentially the same as those in Portland cement. Slag lime cements ground granulated blast furnace slag is not hydraulic on its own but is activated by addition of alkalis most economically using lime. They are similar to pozzolan lime cements in their properties. Only granulated slag i.e. water quenched glassy slag is effective as a cement component. Supersulfated cements contain about ground granulated blast furnace slag gypsum or anhydrite and a little Portland clinker or lime as an activator. They produce strength by formation of ettringite with strength growth similar to a slow Portland cement. They exhibit good resistance to aggressive agents including sulfate. Calcium aluminate cements are hydraulic cements made primarily from limestone and bauxite. The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAlO CaO AlO or CA in Cement chemist notation CCN and mayenite CaAlO CaO AlO or CA in CCN . Strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates. They are well adapted for use in refractory high temperature resistant concretes e.g. for furnace linings. Calcium sulfoaluminate cements are made from clinkers that include ye elimite Ca AlO SO or CAS in Cement chemist s notation as a primary phase. They are used in expansive cements in ultra high early strength cements and in low energy cements. Hydration produces ettringite and specialized physical properties such as expansion or rapid reaction are obtained by adjustment of the availability of calcium and sulfate ions. Their use as a low energy alternative to Portland cement has been pioneered in China where several million tonnes per year are produced. Energy requirements are lower because of the lower kiln temperatures required for reaction and the lower amount of limestone which must be endothermically decarbonated in the mix. In addition the lower limestone content and lower fuel consumption leads to a CO emission around half that associated with Portland clinker. However SO emissions are usually significantly higher. Natural cements corresponding to certain cements of the pre Portland era are produced by burning argillaceous limestones at moderate temperatures. The level of clay components in the limestone around is such that large amounts of belite the low early strength high late strength mineral in Portland cement are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material such cements have highly variable properties. Geopolymer cements are made from mixtures of water soluble alkali metal silicates and aluminosilicate mineral powders such as fly ash and metakaolin. Polymer cements are made from organic chemicals that polymerise. Producers often use thermoset materials. While they are often significantly more expensive they can give a water proof material that has useful tensile strength. Cement starts to set when mixed with water which causes a series of hydration chemical reactions. The constituents slowly hydrate and the mineral hydrates solidify and harden. The interlocking of the hydrates gives cement its strength. Contrary to popular belief hydraulic cement does not set by drying out proper curing requires maintaining the appropriate moisture content necessary for the hydration reactions during the setting and the hardening processes. If hydraulic cements dry out during the curing phase the resulting product can be unsufficiently hydrated and significantly weakened. A minimum temperature of C is recommended and no more than C. The concrete at young age must be protected against water evaporation due to direct insolation elevated temperature low relative humidity and wind. Bags of cement routinely have health and safety warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline but the setting process is exothermic. As a result wet cement is strongly caustic pH . and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements such as chromium from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate FeSO are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate CrO into trivalent chromium Cr a less toxic chemical species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing. In the world production of hydraulic cement was million tonnes . long tons . short tons . The top three producers were China with India with and USA with . million tonnes for a total of over half the world total by the world s three most populated states. For the world capacity to produce cement in the situation was similar with the top three states China India and USA accounting for just under half the world total capacity. Over and global consumption continued to climb rising to Mt in and Mt in while annual growth rates eased to . and . respectively. China representing an increasing share of world cement consumption remains the main engine of global growth. By Chinese demand was recorded at Mt representing of world consumption. Annual growth rates which reached in appear to have softened slowing to over and as China s economy targets a more sustainable growth rate. Outside of China worldwide consumption climbed by . to Mt in to Mt in and finally . to Mt in . Iran is now the rd largest cement producer in the world and has increased its output by over from to . Due to climbing energy costs in Pakistan and other major cement producing countries Iran is in a unique position as a trading partner utilizing its own surplus petroleum to power clinker plants. Now a top producer in the Middle East Iran is further increasing its dominant position in local markets and abroad. The performance in North America and Europe over the period contrasted strikingly with that of China as the global financial crisis evolved into a sovereign debt crisis for many economies in this region and recession. Cement consumption levels for this region fell by . in to Mt recovered by . in then dipped again by . in . The performance in the rest of the world which includes many emerging economies in Asia Africa and Latin America and representing some Mt cement demand in was positive and more than offset the declines in North America and Europe. Annual consumption growth was recorded at . in moderating to . and . in and respectively. As at year end the global cement industry consisted of cement production facilities including both integrated and grinding of which were located in China and in the rest of the world. Total cement capacity worldwide was recorded at Mt in with Mt located in China and Mt in the rest of the world. For the past years China consistently has produced more cement than any other country in the world. ... However China s cement export peaked in with million tonnes shipped out and has been in steady decline ever since. Only . million tonnes were exported out of China in . Offered at a ton Chinese cement is pricing itself out of the market as Thailand is asking as little as for the same quality. In it was estimated that China manufactured . billion tonnes of cement which was of the world total cement production. Demand for cement in China is expected to advance . annually and exceed billion tonnes in driven by slowing but healthy growth in construction expenditures. Cement consumed in China will amount to of global demand and China will remain the world s largest national consumer of cement by a large margin. In . billion tonnes of cement was consumed globally. Of this China accounted for . billion tonnes. Cement manufacture causes environmental impacts at all stages of the process. These include emissions of airborne pollution in the form of dust gases noise and vibration when operating machinery and during blasting in quarries and damage to countryside from quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection also includes the re integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re cultivating them. Carbon concentration in cement spans from in cement structures to in the case of roads in cement. Cement manufacturing releases CO in the atmosphere both directly when calcium carbonate is heated producing lime and carbon dioxide and also indirectly through the use of energy if its production involves the emission of CO. The cement industry produces about of global man made CO emissions of which is from the chemical process and from burning fuel. A Chatham House study from estimates that the billion tonnes of cement produced annually account for of worldwide CO emissions. Nearly kg of CO are emitted for every kg of Portland cement produced. In the European Union the specific energy consumption for the production of cement clinker has been reduced by approximately since the s. This reduction in primary energy requirements is equivalent to approximately million tonnes of coal per year with corresponding benefits in reduction of CO emissions. This accounts for approximately of anthropogenic CO. The majority of carbon dioxide emissions in the manufacture of Portland cement approximately are produced from the chemical decomposition of limestone to lime an ingredient in Portland cement clinker. These emissions may be reduced by lowering the clinker content of cement. They can also be reduced by alternative fabrication methods such as the intergrinding cement with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals to a very fine powder. To reduce the transport of heavier raw materials and to minimize the associated costs it is more economical to build cement plants closer to the limestone quarries rather than to the consumer centers. In certain applications lime mortar reabsorbs some of the CO as was released in its manufacture and has a lower energy requirement in production than mainstream cement. citation needed Newly developed cement types from Novacem and Eco cement can absorb carbon dioxide from ambient air during hardening. As of update carbon capture and storage is about to be trialled but its financial viability is uncertain. In some circumstances mainly depending on the origin and the composition of the raw materials used the high temperature calcination process of limestone and clay minerals can release in the atmosphere gases and dust rich in volatile heavy metals a.o thallium cadmium and mercury are the most toxic. Heavy metals Tl Cd Hg ... and also selenium are often found as trace elements in common metal sulfides pyrite FeS zinc blende ZnS galena PbS ... present as secondary minerals in most of the raw materials. Environmental regulations exist in many countries to limit these emissions. As of in the United States cement kilns are legally allowed to pump more toxins into the air than are hazardous waste incinerators. The presence of heavy metals in the clinker arises both from the natural raw materials and from the use of recycled by products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater . pH . limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. Nickel zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non negligible concentrations. Chromium may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground. As chromate CrO is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr III by addition of ferrous sulfate FeSO . A cement plant consumes to GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced depending on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln referred to as co processing replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels like coal if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by products containing useful minerals such as calcium silica alumina and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln replacing raw materials such as clay shale and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix. Scrap automobile and truck tires are useful in cement manufacturing as they have high calorific value and the iron embedded in tires is useful as a feed stock. p. Clinker is manufactured by heating raw materials inside the main burner of a kiln to a temperature of C. The flame reaches temperatures of C. The material remains at C for seconds at C for seconds also referred to as residence time . These characteristics of a clinker kiln offer numerous benefits and they ensure a complete destruction of organic compounds a total neutralization of acid gases sulphur oxides and hydrogen chloride. Furthermore heavy metal traces are embedded in the clinker structure and no by products such as ash of residues are produced. The EU cement industry already uses more than fuels derived from waste and biomass in supplying the thermal energy to the grey clinker making process. Although the choice for this so called alternative fuels AF is typically cost driven other factors are becoming more important. Use of alternative fuels provides benefits for both society and the company CO emissions are lower than with fossil fuels waste can be co processed in an efficient and sustainable manner and the demand for certain virgin materials can be reduced. Yet there are large differences in the share of alternative fuels used between the European Union EU member states. The societal benefits could be improved if more member states increase their alternative fuels share. The Ecofys study assessed the barriers and opportunities for further uptake of alternative fuels in EU member states. The Ecofys study found that local factors constrain the market potential to a much larger extent than the technical and economic feasibility of the cement industry itself. Green cement is a cementitious material that meets or exceeds the functional performance capabilities of ordinary Portland cement by incorporating and optimizing recycled materials thereby reducing consumption of natural raw materials water and energy resulting in a more sustainable construction material. New manufacturing processes for producing green cement are being researched with the goal to reduce or even eliminate the production and release of damaging pollutants and greenhouse gasses particularly CO. Growing environmental concerns and the increasing cost of fuels of fossil origin have resulted in many countries in a sharp reduction of the resources needed to produce cement and effluents dust and exhaust gases . A team at the University of Edinburgh has developed the DUPE process based on the microbial activity of Sporosarcina pasteurii a bacterium precipitating calcium carbonate which when mixed with sand and urine can produce mortar blocks with a compressive strength of that of conventional construction materials.",FALSE

While once it was possible to describe CSR as an internal organisational policy or a corporate ethic strategy that time has passed as various international laws have been developed and various organisations have used their authority to push it beyond individual or even industry wide initiatives. While it has been considered a form of corporate self regulation for some time over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organisations to mandatory schemes at regional national and even transnational levels. Considered at the organisational level CSR is generally understood as a private firm policy. As such it must align with and be integrated into a business model to be successful. With some models a firm s implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory requirements and engages in actions that appear to further some social good beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law . The choices of complying with the law failing to comply and going beyond are three distinct strategic organisational choices. While in many areas such as environmental or labor regulations employers may choose to comply with the law or go beyond the law other organisations may choose to flout the law. These organisations are taking on clear legal risks. The nature of the legal risk however changes when attention is paid to soft law. Soft law may incur legal liability particularly when businesses make misleading claims about their sustainability or other ethical credentials and practices. Overall businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes. From a strategic perspective the aim is to increase long term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers employees investors communities and others. From an ethical perspective some businesses will adopt CSR policies and practices because of ethical beliefs of senior management. For example a CEO may believe that harming the environment is ethically objectionable. Proponents argue that corporations increase long term profits by operating with a CSR perspective while critics argue that CSR distracts from businesses economic role. A study compared existing econometric studies of the relationship between social and financial performance concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive negative and neutral financial impact were due to flawed empirical analysis and claimed when the study is properly specified CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes. Critics questioned the lofty and sometimes unrealistic expectations in CSR. or that CSR is merely window dressing or an attempt to pre empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful multinational corporations. In line with this critical perspective political and sociological institutionalists became interested in CSR in the context of theories of globalization neoliberalism and late capitalism. Some institutionalists viewed CSR as a form of capitalist legitimacy and in particular point out that what began as a social movement against uninhibited corporate power was transformed by corporations into a business model and a risk management device often with questionable results. CSR is titled to aid an organization s mission as well as serve as a guide to what the company represents for its consumers. Business ethics is the part of applied ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment. ISO is the recognized international standard for CSR. Public sector organizations the United Nations for example adhere to the triple bottom line TBL . It is widely accepted that CSR adheres to similar principles but with no formal act of legislation. Since the s corporate social responsibility has attracted attention from a range of businesses and stakeholders. A wide variety of definitions have been developed but with little consensus. Part of the problem with definitions has arisen because of the different interests represented. A business person may define CSR as a business strategy an NGO activist may see it as greenwash while a government official may see it as voluntary regulation. In addition disagreement about the definition will arise from the disciplinary approach. For example while an economist might consider the director s discretion necessary for CSR to be implemented a risk of agency costs a law academic may consider that discretion to be an appropriate expression of what the law demands from directors. Corporate social responsibility has been defined by Sheehy as international private business self regulation. Sheehy examined a range of different disciplinary approaches to defining CSR. The definitions reviewed included the economic definition of sacrificing profits a management definition of beyond compliance institutionalist views of CSR as a socio political movement and law s own focus on directors duties. Further Sheehy considered Archie Carroll s description of CSR as a pyramid of responsibilities namely economic legal ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. While Carroll was not defining CSR but simply arguing for classification of activities Sheehy developed a definition differently following the philosophy of science the branch of philosophy used for defining phenomena. Carroll extended corporate social responsibility from the traditional economic and legal responsibility to ethical and philanthropic responsibility in response to the rising concerns on ethical issues in businesses. This view is reflected in the Business Dictionary which defines CSR as a company s sense of responsibility towards the community and environment both ecological and social in which it operates. Companies express this citizenship through their waste and pollution reduction processes by contributing educational and social programs and by earning adequate returns on the employed resources. Most consumers agree that while achieving business targets companies should engage in CSR efforts at the same time. Most consumers believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response. Somerville also found that consumers are loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity. Consumers also believe that retailers selling local products will gain loyalty. Smith shares the belief that marketing local products will gain consumer trust. However environmental efforts are receiving negative views given the belief that this would affect customer service. Oppewal et al. found that not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers. They recommended that retailers focus on one activity. Becker Olsen found that if the social initiative done by the company is not aligned with other company goals it will have a negative impact. Mohr et al. and Groza et al. also emphasise the importance of reaching the consumer. Some commentators have identified a difference between the Canadian Montreal school of CSR the Continental European and the Anglo Saxon approaches to CSR. It is said that for Chinese consumers a socially responsible company makes safe high quality products for Germans it provides secure employment in South Africa it makes a positive contribution to social needs such as health care and education. Even within Europe the discussion about CSR is very heterogeneous. A more common approach to CSR is corporate philanthropy. This includes monetary donations and aid given to nonprofit organizations and communities. Donations are made in areas such as the arts education housing health social welfare and the environment among others but excluding political contributions and commercial event sponsorship. Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into operations such as procurement of Fair Trade tea and coffee. Creating shared value or CSV is based on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent. A business needs a healthy educated workforce sustainable resources and adept government to compete effectively. For society to thrive profitable and competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income wealth tax revenues and philanthropy. The Harvard Business Review article Strategy Society The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility provided examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and CSR. CSV acknowledges trade offs between short term profitability and social or environmental goals but emphasizes the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy. CSV gives the impression that only two stakeholders are important shareholders and consumers. Many companies employ benchmarking to assess their CSR policy implementation and effectiveness. Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor initiatives as well as measuring and evaluating the impact that those policies have on society and the environment and how others perceive competitor CSR strategy. In competitive markets cost benefit analysis of CSR initiatives can be examined using a resource based view RBV . According to Barney formulation of the RBV sustainable competitive advantage requires that resources be valuable V rare R inimitable I and non substitutable S . A firm introducing a CSR based strategy might only sustain high returns on their investment if their CSR based strategy could not be copied I . However should competitors imitate such a strategy that might increase overall social benefits. Firms that choose CSR for strategic financial gain are also acting responsibly. RBV presumes that firms are bundles of heterogeneous resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers can determine the appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting cost benefit analysis in the same way that they analyze other investments. Reinhardt found that a firm engaging in a CSR based strategy could only sustain an abnormal return if it could prevent competitors from imitating its strategy. Initially CSR emphasized the official behaviour of individual firms. Later it expanded to include supplier behaviour and the uses to which products were put and how they were disposed of after they lost value. In the st century corporate social responsibility in the supply chain has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders. Corporations supply chain is the process by which several organizations including suppliers customers and logistics providers work together to provide a value package of products and services to the end user who is the customer. Corporate social irresponsibility in the supply chain has greatly affected the reputation of companies leading to a lot of cost to solve the problems. For instance incidents like the Savar building collapse which killed over people pushed companies to consider the impacts of their operations on society and environment. On the other side the horse meat scandal of in the United Kingdom affected many food retailers including Tesco the largest retailer in the United Kingdom leading to the dismissal of the supplier. Corporate social irresponsibility from both the suppliers and the retailers has greatly affected the stakeholders who lost trust for the affected business entities and despite the fact that sometimes it s not directly undertaken by the companies they become accountable to the stakeholders. These surrounding issues have prompted supply chain management to consider the corporate social responsibility context. Wieland and Handfield suggested that companies need to include social responsibility in their reviews of component quality. They highlighted the use of technology in improving visibility across the supply chain. Corporate social responsibility includes six types of corporate social initiatives All six of the corporate initiatives are forms of corporate citizenship. However only some of these CSR activities rise to the level of cause marketing defined as a type of corporate social responsibility CSR in which a company s promotional campaign has the dual purpose of increasing profitability while bettering society. Companies generally do not have a profit motive when participating in corporate philanthropy and community volunteering. On the other hand the remaining corporate social initiatives can be examples of cause marketing in which there is both a societal interest and profit motive. CSR may be based within the human resources business development or public relations departments of an organisation or may be a separate unit reporting to the CEO or the board of directors. An engagement plan can assist in reaching a desired audience. A corporate social responsibility individual or team plans the goals and objectives of the organization. As with any corporate activity a defined budget demonstrates commitment and scales the program s relative importance. Social accounting is the communication of social and environmental effects of a company s economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large. Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate accountability. Crowther defines social accounting as an approach to reporting a firm s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behavior the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques. Reporting guidelines and standards serve as frameworks for social accounting auditing and reporting In nations such as France legal requirements for social accounting auditing and reporting exist though international or national agreement on meaningful measurements of social and environmental performance has not been achieved. Many companies produce externally audited annual reports that cover Sustainable Development and CSR issues Triple Bottom Line Reports but the reports vary widely in format style and evaluation methodology even within the same industry . Critics dismiss these reports as lip service citing examples such as Enron s yearly Corporate Responsibility Annual Report and tobacco companies social reports. In South Africa as of June all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange JSE were required to produce an integrated report in place of an annual financial report and sustainability report. An integrated report reviews environmental social and economic performance alongside financial performance. This requirement was implemented in the absence of formal or legal standards. An Integrated Reporting Committee IRC was established to issue guidelines for good practice. One of the reputable institutions that capital markets turn to for credible sustainability reports is the Carbon Disclosure Project or CDP. Corporate social responsibility and its resulting reports and efforts should be verified by the consumer of the goods and services. The accounting auditing and reporting resources provide a foundation for consumers to verify that their products are socially sustainable. Due to an increased awareness of the need for CSR many industries have their own verification resources. The include organizations like the Forest Stewardship Council paper and forest products International Cocoa Initiative and Kimberly Process diamonds . The United Nations also provides frameworks not only for verification but for reporting of human rights violations in corporate supply chains. The rise of ethics training inside corporations some of it required by government regulation has helped CSR to spread. The aim of such training is to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear. The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of dirty hands fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms. Organizations see increased employee loyalty and pride in the organization. Common CSR actions include Social License to Operate can be determined as a contractual grounds for the legitimacy of activities and projects company is involved in. It refers to the level of support and approval of a company s activities by its stakeholders. Displaying commitment to CSR is one way to achieve social license by enhancing a company s reputation. As stated in Enduring value the Australian minerals industry framework for sustainable development the concept of the social license to operate then defined simply as obtaining and maintaining broad community support and acceptance. Unless a company earns and maintains that license social license holders may intend to block project developments employees may leave the company for a company that is a better corporate citizen and companies may be under ongoing legal challenge. In research of Requisite Organization Dr Elliott Jaques defines Social License to Operate for the company as the social contract the company has with the social license holders employees trade unions communities government for them to manifest positive intention to support the business short and long term objectives by providing managerial leadership that nurtures the social good and also gives the foundation for sustainable growth in organizational results. The primary objective for the companies is to obtain and maintain the Social License to Operate. Based on the Requisite Organization research of Dr. Elliott Jaques to achieve this goal a company needs to A large body of literature exhorts business to adopt non financial measures of success e.g. Deming s Fourteen Points balanced scorecards . While CSR benefits are hard to quantify Orlitzky Schmidt and Rynes found a correlation between social environmental performance and financial performance. The business case for CSR within a company employs one or more of these arguments People planet and profit also known as the triple bottom line form one way to evaluate CSR. People refers to fair labour practices the community and region where the business operates. Planet refers to sustainable environmental practices. Profit is the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs including the cost of the capital unlike accounting definitions of profit . This measure was claimed to help some companies be more conscious of their social and moral responsibilities. However critics claim that it is selective and substitutes a company s perspective for that of the community. Another criticism is about the absence of a standard auditing procedure. The term was coined by John Elkington in . A CSR program can be an aid to recruitment and retention particularly within the competitive graduate student market. Potential recruits often consider a firm s CSR policy. CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff particularly when staff can become involved through payroll giving fundraising activities or community volunteering. CSR has been credited with encouraging customer orientation among customer facing employees. CSR is known for impacting employee turnover. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and that the ability to retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces employee turnover. Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance. The IBM Institute for Business Value conducted a survey of business leaders worldwide in . The survey found out that businesses have assimilated a much more strategic view and that companies reported are utilizing CSR as an opportunity and part of a sustainable growth strategy. The authors noted that while developing and implementing a CSR strategy represents a unique opportunity to benefit the company. However only of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company s CSR objectives and initiatives. The survey s authors also stated that employee engagement on CSR initiatives can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. As a result employees tend to discard employers with a bad reputation. Managing risk is an important executive responsibility. Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through corruption scandals or environmental accidents. These draw unwanted attention from regulators courts governments and media. CSR can limit these risks. CSR can help build customer loyalty based on distinctive ethical values. Some companies use their commitment to CSR as their primary positioning tool e.g. The Co operative Group The Body Shop and American Apparel. Some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions as another form of advertising. Companies that operate strong CSR activities tend to drive customer s attention to buy products or services regardless of the price. As a result this increases competition among firms since customers are aware of the company s CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company but also to the products or services. Furthermore firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm s performance. Lowering the carbon footprint of a firm s distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario customers can observe the company s commitment to CSR while increasing company sales. Whole Foods marketing and promotion of organic foods have had a positive effect on the supermarket industry. Proponents assert that Whole Foods has been able to work with its suppliers to improve animal treatment and quality of meat offered in their stores. They also promote local agricultures in over independent farms to maintain their line of sustainable organic produce. As a result Whole Foods high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. In fact they are pleased buying organic products that come from sustainable practices. According to a Harvard Business Review article there are three theaters of practice in which CSR can be divided. Theater one focuses on philanthropy which includes donations of money or equipment to non profit organizations engagement with communities initiatives and employee volunteering. This is characterized as the soul of a company expressing the social and environmental priorities of the founders. The authors assert that companies engage in CSR because they are an integral part of the society. The Coca Cola Company contributes with . million annually to a variety of environmental educational and humanitarian organization. Another example is PNC Financial Services Grow Up Great childhood education program. This program provides critical school readiness resources to underserved communities where PNC operates. On the other hand theater two focuses on improving operational effectiveness in the workplace. The researchers assert that programs in this theater strive to deliver social or environmental benefits to support a company s operation across the value chain by improving efficiency. Some of the examples mentioned include sustainability initiatives to reduce resource use waste and emission that could potentially reduce costs. It also calls for investing in employee work conditions such as health care and education which may enhance productivity and retention. Unlike philanthropic giving which is evaluated by its social and environmental return initiatives in the second theater are predicted to improve the corporate bottom line with social value. Bimbo the largest bakery in Mexico is an excellent example of this theater. The company strives to meet social welfare needs. It offers free educational service to help employees complete high school. Bimbo also provides supplementary medical care and financial assistance to close gaps in the government health coverage. Moreover the third theater program aims to transform the business model. Basically companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges that will lead to financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in Unilever s Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro finance loans to sell soaps oils detergents and other products door to door. This research indicates that more than women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is IKEA s People and Planet initiative to be sustainable by . As a consequence the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture. Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through taxation or regulations. A CSR program can persuade governments and the public that a company takes health and safety diversity and the environment seriously reducing the likelihood that company practices will be closely monitored. Appropriate CSR programs can increase the attractiveness of supplier firms to potential customer corporations. E.g. a fashion merchandiser may find value in an overseas manufacturer that uses CSR to establish a positive image and to reduce the risks of bad publicity from uncovered misbehavior. CSR strategy or behaviors related to CSR was discussed by many scholars in terms of crisis management like responses to boycott in an international context. Ang found that relationship building through providing additional services rather than price cutting is what businesses in Asia feel more comfortable with as a strategy during an economic crisis. Regarding direct research about strategies in cross cultural crisis management scholars found that CSR strategies could make effects through empirical case studies of involving multinational businesses in China. They found that meeting local stakeholders social expectations can mitigate the risk of crises. The strategy utilized by Arla Foods works and has helped the company in regaining the most of its lost market share among many countries in the Middle East. Arla Foods founded a funding for children with cancer and they donated ambulances to refugees in Lebanon. As what Arla Foods did they tried to contribute to solve social problems of children s access to health care which were local priorities. Other researchers analyzed the case of multinational enterprise strategies under the context of conflicts between Lebanon and Israel. During the conflict many companies stressed seeking to help the local community. In the post conflict stage managers highlighted their philanthropic programs and contributions in terms of monetary in kind donations to the refugees or businesses that were directly affected. For example Citibank has provided monetary assistance to some local businesses affected by the war. Another activity did by a Lebanon company was a fund raising campaign. Moreover some researchers conclude that making charitable contributions emphasizing local connections and demonstrating the impact on the local economy are strategic responses to the crisis of the boycott. CSR concerns include its relationship to the purpose of business and the motives for engaging in it. Milton Friedman and others argued that a corporation s purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders and that obeying the laws of the jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior. While some CSR supporters claim that companies practicing CSR especially in developing countries are less likely to exploit workers and communities critics claim that CSR itself imposes outside values on local communities with unpredictable outcomes. Better governmental regulation and enforcement rather than voluntary measures are an alternative to CSR that moves decision making and resource allocation from public to private bodies. However critics claim that effective CSR must be voluntary as mandatory social responsibility programs regulated by the government interferes with people s own plans and preferences distorts the allocation of resources and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions. Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that the reputational benefits that CSR companies receive cited above as a benefit to the corporation demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach. Moreover some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers personal interests at the cost of the shareholders so they are a type of an agency problem in corporations. Others have argued that the primary purpose of CSR is to provide legitimacy to the power of businesses. As wealth inequality is perceived to be increasing it has become increasingly necessary for businesses to justify their position of power. Bakan is one of the most prominent critics of the conflict of interest between private profit and public good and his argument is summarised by Haynes that a corporate calculus exists in which costs are pushed onto both workers consumers and the environment . CSR spending may be seen in these financial terms whereby the higher costs of socially undesirable behaviour are offset by a CSR spending of a lower amount. Indeed it has been argued that there is a halo effect in terms of CSR spending. Research has found that firms which had been convicted of bribery in the US under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA received more lenient fines if they had been seen to be actively engaging in comprehensive CSR practices. It was found that typically either a increase in corporate giving or a commitment to eradicating a significant labour issue such as child labour was equated to a lower fine in the case of bribing foreign officials. Aguinis and Glavas conducted a comprehensive review of CSR literature covering academic sources from numerous fields including organizational behaviour corporate strategy marketing and HRM. It was found that the primary reason for firms to engage in CSR were the expected financial benefits associated with CSR rather than being motivated a desire to be responsible to society. CEOs political ideologies are evident manifestations of their different personal views. Each CEO may exercise different powers according to their organizational outcomes. In fact their political ideologies are expected to influence their preferences for the CSR outcomes. Proponents argue that politically liberal CEOs will envision the practice of CSR as beneficial and desirable to increase a firm s reputation. They tend to focus more on how the firm can meet the needs of the society. As a consequence they will advance with the practice of CSR while adding value to the firm. On the other hand property rights may be more relevant to conservative CEOs. Since conservatives tend to value free markets individualism and call for a respect of authority they will not likely envision this practice as often as those identifying as liberals might. The financials of the company and the practice of CSR also have a positive relationship. Moreover the performance of a company tends to influence conservatives more likely than liberals. While not seeing it from the financial performance point of view liberals tend to hold a view that CSR adds to the business triple bottom line. For instance when the company is performing well they will most likely promote CSR. If the company is not performing as expected they will rather tend to emphasize this practice because they will potentially envision it as a way to add value to the business. In contrast politically conservative CEOs will tend to support the practice of CSR if they hold a view that it will provide a good return to the financials of the company. In other words this type of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange. There have been unsubstantiated social efforts ethical claims and outright greenwashing by some companies that has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust. Sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other harmful business practices. For example McDonald s Corporation positioned its association with Ronald McDonald House and other children s charities as CSR while its meals have been accused of promoting poor eating habits. Acts which may initially appear to be altruistic CSR may have ulterior motives. The funding of scientific research projects has been used as a source of misdirection by firms. Prusiner who discovered the protein responsible of CJD and won the Nobel prize in Medicine thanked the tobacco company RJ Reynolds for their crucial support. RJ Reynolds funded the research into CJD. Proctor states that the tobacco industry was the leading funder of research into genetics viruses immunology air pollution anything which formed a distraction from the well established research linking smoking and cancer. Research has also found that corporate social marketing a form of CSR promoting societal good is being used to direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry. It has been shown that adverts which supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a social norm. Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in this case to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing. Industries such as tobacco alcohol or munitions firms make products that damage their consumers or the environment. Such firms may engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries. This duality complicates assessments of such firms with respect to CSR. Textile company Kitex has taken over the administration of an entire Indian village called Kizhakkambalam near Cochin by winning the local body elections. Environmentalists and mainstream politicians of India point out that this can lead to a dangerous precedent because the company got actively involved in CSR only after they were caught red handed in polluting the village. One motivation for corporations to adopt CSR is to satisfy stakeholders beyond those of a corporation s shareholders. Branco and Rodrigues describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the set of views of corporate responsibility held by all groups or constituents with a relationship to the firm. In their normative model the company accepts these views as long as they do not hinder the organization. The stakeholder perspective fails to acknowledge the complexity of network interactions that can occur in cross sector partnerships. It relegates communication to a maintenance function similar to the exchange perspective. The rise in popularity of ethical consumerism over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day to day consumption decisions and in some cases make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns. One issue with the consumer s relationship with CSR is that it is much more complex than it first appears. In their paper on the consumer and CSR Janssen and Vanhamme looked into a phenomenon that they termed the CSR Consumer Paradox . This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. A survey by Cohn Wolfe found that globally over of consumers want to buy from responsible companies. However Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than of average household expenditure in the UK in was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions and actual consumer behaviour so that when it comes down to their actual purchase behaviour CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say it does. One theory put forward for explaining the CSR Consumer Paradox is that of bystander apathy or the bystander effect. This theory stems from the social psychology works of Darley and Latan and states that the likelihood of an individual acting in a given situation is greatly reduced if other bystanders do nothing even if that individual strongly believes in a certain course of action. In terms of explaining the CSR Consumer Paradox this theory would suggest an If they do not care then why should I mentality. So even if a consumer is against the use of sweatshops or wants to support green causes they may continue to make purchases from companies that are socially irresponsible just because other consumers seem apathetic towards the issue. A second explanation issued by Janssen and Vanhamme is that of reciprocal altruism. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour people only do something if they can get something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism however consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non ethical counterpart. Therefore evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically environmentally and socially beneficial causes. Shareholders and investors through socially responsible investing SRI are using their capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary. For example some religious investors in the US have withdrawn investment from companies that violate their religious views while secular investors divest from companies that they see as imposing religious views on workers or customers. Some national governments promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate practices. The heightened role of government in CSR has facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies. Various European governments have pushed companies to develop sustainable corporate practices. CSR critics such as Robert Reich argued that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility with laws and regulation that describe how to conduct business responsibly. Fifteen European Union countries are actively engaged in CSR regulation and public policy development. CSR efforts and policies are different among countries responding to the complexity and diversity of governmental corporate and societal roles. Some studies have claimed that the role and effectiveness of these actors were case specific. This variety among company approaches to CSR can complicate regulatory processes. Canada adopted CSR in . Prime Minister Harper encouraged Canadian mining companies to meet Canada s newly developed CSR standards. The Heilbronn Declaration is a voluntary agreement of enterprises and institutions in Germany especially of the Heilbronn Franconia region signed on September . The approach of the Heilbronn Declaration targets the decisive factors of success or failure the achievements of the implementation and best practices regarding CSR. A form of responsible entrepreneurship shall be initiated to meet the requirements of stakeholders trust in economy. It is an approach to make voluntary commitments more binding. In opposition to mandated CSR regulation Researchers Armstrong Green suggest that all regulation is harmful citing regulation as the cause for North Korea s low economic freedom and per capita GDP. They further claim without source that There is no form of market failure however egregious which is not eventually made worse by the political interventions intended to fix it and conclude there is no need for further research on regulation in the name of social responsibility. In the s the US government could take away a firm s license if it acted irresponsibly. Corporations were viewed as creatures of the state under the law. In the United States Supreme Court in Dartmouth College vs. Woodward established a corporation as a legal person in specific contexts. This ruling allowed corporations to be protected under the Constitution and prevented states from regulating firms. Recently countries included CSR policies in government agendas. On December the Danish parliament adopted a bill making it mandatory for the largest Danish companies investors and state owned companies to include CSR information in their financial reports. The reporting requirements became effective on January . The required information included CSR SRI is voluntary in Denmark but if a company has no policy on this it must state its positioning on CSR in financial reports. In item SK of the Income Tax Act of Mauritius mandated that companies registered in Mauritius paid of their annual book profit to contribute to the social and environmental development of the country. In India also enacted a mandatory minimum CSR spending law. Under Companies Act any company having a net worth of crore or more or a turnover of crore or a net profit of crore must spend of their net profits on CSR activities. The rules came into effect from April . The only mandatory CSR law in the world thus far was passed by the Indian parliament in as Article of the Companies Law. According to that bill all firms with net worth above million turnover over million or net profit over are required to spend at least of their annual profits averaged over three years . The law requires that all businesses affected establish a CSR committee to oversee the spending. Prior to this law s passage CSR laws applied to public sector companies only. Unlike global definitions of CSR which are in the triple bottom line corporate citizenship sustainable business business responsibility and closed loop realm in India CSR is a philanthropic activity. What has changed since formalizing it in is the shift in focus from institution building schools hospitals etc to focusing on community development. Crises have encouraged the adoption of CSR. The CERES principles were adopted following the Exxon Valdez incident. Other examples include the lead paint used by toy maker Mattel which required the recall of millions of toys and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. Magellan Metals was found responsible for lead contamination killing thousands of birds in Australia. The company ceased business immediately and had to work with independent regulatory bodies to execute a cleanup. Odwalla experienced a crisis with sales dropping and its stock price dropping due to cases of E. coli. The company recalled all apple or carrot juice products and introduced a new process called flash pasteurization as well as maintaining lines of communication constantly open with customers. Corporations that employ CSR behaviors do not always behave consistently in all parts of the world. Conversely a single behavior may not be considered ethical in all jurisdictions. E.g. some jurisdictions forbid women from driving while others require women to be treated equally in employment decisions. A study found that the UK retail sector showed the greatest rate of CSR involvement. Many of the big retail companies in the UK joined the Ethical Trading Initiative an association established to improve working conditions and worker health. Tesco reported that their essentials are Trading responsibility Reducing our Impact on the Environment Being a Great Employer and Supporting Local Communities . J Sainsbury employs the headings Best for food and health Sourcing with integrity Respect for our environment Making a difference to our community and A great place to work etc. The four main issues to which UK retail these companies committed are environment social welfare ethical trading and becoming an attractive workplace. Anselmsson and Johansson assessed three areas of CSR performance human responsibility product responsibility and environmental responsibility. Martinuzzi et al. described the terms writing that human responsibility is the company deals with suppliers who adhere to principles of natural and good breeding and farming of animals and also maintains fair and positive working conditions and work place environments for their own employees. Product responsibility means that all products come with a full and complete list of content that country of origin is stated that the company will uphold its declarations of intent and assume liability for its products. Environmental responsibility means that a company is perceived to produce environmental friendly ecological and non harmful products . Jones et al. found that environmental issues are the most commonly reported CSR programs among top retailers. An article published in Forbes.com last September mentioned the yearly study of Boston based reputation management consulting company Reputation Institute RI which rates the top US corporations in terms of corporate social responsibility. RI monitors social responsibility reputations by focusing on perception of consumers regarding company governance positive impact on the community and society and treatment of the workforce. It rates each criterion with the firm s proprietary RepTrak Pulse platform. Forbes identified the companies as Lego Microsoft Google Walt Disney Company BMW Group Intel Robert Bosch Cisco Systems Rolls Royce Aerospace and Colgate Palmolive. According to the CSR Journal the millennial generation worldwide helps propel brands toward social responsibility. Many millennials want to conduct business with companies and trademarks that employ pro social themes sustainable manufacturing processes and ethical business practices. Nielsen Holdings published its Annual Global Corporate Sustainability Report in concentrating on global responsibility as well as sustainability. Nielsen s report showed that percent of consumers will spend more on products that come from sustainable brands. Another percent expect their preferred corporate institutions to reveal in public their statements about corporate citizenship The National Association on the Advancement of Colored People NAACP through its chief executive officer Derrick Johnson shared the organization s insights on how American corporations can help in the realization of social justice. According to the article from Yahoo News the NAACP has been engaged in a crusade for racial justice and economic opportunities during the last years. This organization believes all citizens in the United States must be held liable in ensuring democracy works for all people.",FALSE
"64",64,"ecological civilization","/wiki/Ecological_civilization",FALSE,0,"null","Ecological civilization is the final goal of social and environmental reform within a given society","Ecological civilization is the final goal of social and environmental reform within a given society. It implies that the changes required in response to global climate disruption and social injustices are so extensive as to represent another form of human civilization one based on ecological principles. Broadly construed ecological civilization involves a synthesis of economic educational political agricultural and other societal reforms toward sustainability. Although the term was first coined in the s it did not see widespread use until when ecological civilization became an explicit goal of the Communist Party of China CPC . In April the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and the International Ecological Safety Collaborative Organization founded a sub committee on ecological civilization. Proponents of ecological civilization agree with Pope Francis who writes We are faced not with two separate crises one environmental and the other social but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty restoring dignity to the excluded and at the same time protecting nature. As such ecological civilization emphasizes the need for major environmental and social reforms that are both long term and systemic in orientation. In former Soviet Union environment experts proposed the term Ecological Culture in an article entitled Ways of Fostering Ecological Culture in Individuals under the Conditions of Mature Socialism which was published in Scientific Communism Moscow vol. . A summary of this article was published in the Chinese newspaper the Guangming Daily where the notion of ecological culture was translated into Chinese as sh ngti wnmng or ecological civilization. Two years later the concept of ecological civilization was picked up in China and was first used by Ye Qianji an agricultural economist in . Professor Ye defined ecological civilization by drawing from the ecological sciences and environmental philosophy. The first time the phrase ecological civilization was used as a technical term in an English language book was in . Roy Morrison an environmentalist coined the phrase in his book Ecological Democracy writing that An ecological civilization is based on diverse lifeways sustaining linked natural and social ecologies. The term is found more extensively in Chinese discussions beginning in . In the Communist Party of China CPC included the goal of achieving an ecological civilization in its constitution and it also featured in its five year plan. In the Chinese context the term generally presupposes the framework of a constructive postmodernism as opposed to an extension of modernist practices or a deconstructive postmodernism which stems from the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida. Both ecological civilization and constructive postmodernism have been associated with the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead. David Ray Griffin a process philosopher and professor at Claremont School of Theology first used the term constructive postmodernism in his book Varieties of Postmodern Theology. The largest international conference held on the theme ecological civilization Seizing an Alternative Toward an Ecological Civilization took place at Pomona College in June bringing together roughly participants from around the world and featuring such leaders in the environmental movement as Bill McKibben Vandana Shiva John B. Cobb Jr. Wes Jackson and Sheri Liao. Since the Chinese discussion of ecological civilization is increasingly associated with an organic form of Marxism. Organic Marxism was first used by Philip Clayton and Justin Heinzekehr in their book Organic Marxism An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe. The book which was translated into Chinese and published by the People s Press in describes ecological civilization as an orienting goal for the global ecological movement. A defence of ecological civilization as the ultimate goal of humanity has been mounted by Arran Gare in The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization A Manifesto for the Future which was published in .",FALSE
"65",65,"land use","/wiki/Land_use",TRUE,0,"field|","Land use involves the management and modification of natural environment or wilderness into built environment such as settlements and semi natural habitats such as arable fields pastures and managed woods","Land use involves the management and modification of natural environment or wilderness into built environment such as settlements and semi natural habitats such as arable fields pastures and managed woods. It also has been defined as the total of arrangements activities and inputs that people undertake in a certain land cover type. Land use practices vary considerably across the world. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Water Development Division explains that Land use concerns the products and or benefits obtained from use of the land as well as the land management actions activities carried out by humans to produce those products and benefits. As of the early s about of the Earth was considered arable land with in pasture forests and woodland and . urban areas. Land change modeling can be used to predict and assess future shifts in land use. As Albert Guttenberg wrote many years ago Land use is a key term in the language of city planning. Commonly political jurisdictions will undertake land use planning and regulate the use of land in an attempt to avoid land use conflicts. Land use plans are implemented through land division and use ordinances and regulations such as zoning regulations. Management consulting firms and non governmental organizations will frequently seek to influence these regulations before they are codified. In colonial America few regulations existed to control the use of land due to the seemingly endless amounts of it. As society shifted from rural to urban public land regulation became important especially to city governments trying to control industry commerce and housing within their boundaries. The first zoning ordinance was passed in New York City in and by the s most states had adopted zoning laws. In the s concerns about the environment and historic preservation led to further regulation. Today federal state and local governments regulate growth and development through statutory law. The majority of controls on land however stem from the actions of private developers and individuals. Three typical situations bringing such private entities into the court system are suits brought by one neighbor against another suits brought by a public official against a neighboring landowner on behalf of the public and suits involving individuals who share ownership of a particular parcel of land. In these situations judicial decisions and enforcement of private land use arrangements can reinforce public regulation and achieve forms and levels of control that regulatory zoning cannot. Two major federal laws have been passed in the last half century that limit the use of land significantly. These are the National Historic Preservation Act of today embodied in U.S.C. et seq. and the National Environmental Policy Act of U.S.C. et seq. . The US Department of Agriculture has identified six major types of land use in the US. Acreage statistics for each type of land use in the contiguous states in were as follows Special use areas include national parks M acres and state parks M wildlife areas . M highways M railroads M military bases M airports M and a few others. Miscellaneous includes cemeteries golf courses marshes deserts and other areas of low economic value . The total land area of the US is . M km but the total used here refers only to the contiguous states without Alaska etc. Land use and land management practices have a major impact on natural resources including water soil nutrients plants and animals. Land use information can be used to develop solutions for natural resource management issues such as salinity and water quality. For instance water bodies in a region that has been deforested or having erosion will have different water quality than those in areas that are forested. Forest gardening a plant based food production system is believed to be the oldest form of land use in the world. The major effect of land use on land cover since has been deforestation of temperate regions. dead link More recent significant effects of land use include urban sprawl soil erosion soil degradation salinization and desertification. Land use change together with use of fossil fuels are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide a dominant greenhouse gas. According to a report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization land degradation has been exacerbated where there has been an absence of any land use planning or of its orderly execution or the existence of financial or legal incentives that have led to the wrong land use decisions or one sided central planning leading to over utilization of the land resources for instance for immediate production at all costs. As a consequence the result has often been misery for large segments of the local population and destruction of valuable ecosystems. Such narrow approaches should be replaced by a technique for the planning and management of land resources that is integrated and holistic and where land users are central. This will ensure the long term quality of the land for human use the prevention or resolution of social conflicts related to land use and the conservation of ecosystems of high biodiversity value. The urban growth boundary is one form of land use regulation. For example Portland Oregon is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least acres km of vacant land. Additionally Oregon restricts the development of farmland. The regulations are controversial but an economic analysis concluded that farmland appreciated similarly to the other land.",FALSE
"66",66,"metal","/wiki/Metal",TRUE,0,"poli|material|material|","A metal from Greek mtallon mine quarry metal is a material that when freshly prepared polished or fractured shows a lustrous appearance and conducts electricity and heat relatively well","A metal from Greek mtallon mine quarry metal is a material that when freshly prepared polished or fractured shows a lustrous appearance and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable they can be hammered into thin sheets or ductile can be drawn into wires . A metal may be a chemical element such as iron or an alloy such as stainless steel. In physics a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero. Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures. For example the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between and thousand times atmospheric pressure. Equally some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals. Sodium for example becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure. In chemistry two elements that would otherwise qualify in physics as brittle metals arsenic and antimony are commonly instead recognised as metalloids on account of their predominately non metallic chemistry. Around of the elements in the periodic table are metals or are likely to be such . The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals nonmetals and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. In astrophysics the term metal is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than the lightest two hydrogen and helium and not just traditional metals. A star fuses lighter atoms mostly hydrogen and helium into heavier atoms over its lifetime. Used in that sense the metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements. Metals comprise of the Earth s crust and are present in many aspects of modern life. The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in for example high rise building and bridge construction as well as most vehicles many home appliances tools pipes and railroad tracks. Precious metals were historically used as coinage but in the modern era coinage metals have extended to at least of the chemical elements. The history of metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about years ago. Gold silver iron as meteoric iron lead and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the th millennium BCE. Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel the discovery of sodium the first light metal in the rise of modern alloy steels and since the end of World War II the development of more sophisticated alloys. Metals are shiny and lustrous at least when freshly prepared polished or fractured. Sheets of metal thicker than a few micrometres appear opaque but gold leaf transmits green light. The solid or liquid state of metals largely originates in the capacity of the metal atoms involved to readily lose their outer shell electrons. Broadly the forces holding an individual atom s outer shell electrons in place are weaker than the attractive forces on the same electrons arising from interactions between the atoms in the solid or liquid metal. The electrons involved become delocalised and the atomic structure of a metal can effectively be visualised as a collection of atoms embedded in a cloud of relatively mobile electrons. This type of interaction is called a metallic bond. The strength of metallic bonds for different elemental metals reaches a maximum around the center of the transition metal series as these elements have large numbers of delocalized electrons. n Although most elemental metals have higher densities than most nonmetals there is a wide variation in their densities lithium being the least dense . g cm and osmium . g cm the most dense. Magnesium aluminium and titanium are light metals of significant commercial importance. Their respective densities of . . and . g cm can be compared to those of the older structural metals like iron at . and copper at . g cm. An iron ball would thus weigh about as much as three aluminium balls. Metals are typically malleable and ductile deforming under stress without cleaving. The nondirectional nature of metallic bonding is thought to contribute significantly to the ductility of most metallic solids. In contrast in an ionic compound like table salt when the planes of an ionic bond slide past one another the resultant change in location shifts ions of the same charge into close proximity resulting in the cleavage of the crystal. Such a shift is not observed in a covalently bonded crystal such as a diamond where fracture and crystal fragmentation occurs. Reversible elastic deformation in metals can be described by Hooke s Law for restoring forces where the stress is linearly proportional to the strain. Heat or forces larger than a metal s elastic limit may cause a permanent irreversible deformation known as plastic deformation or plasticity. An applied force may be a tensile pulling force a compressive pushing force or a shear bending or torsion twisting force. A temperature change may affect the movement or displacement of structural defects in the metal such as grain boundaries point vacancies line and screw dislocations stacking faults and twins in both crystalline and non crystalline metals. Internal slip creep and metal fatigue may ensue. The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures namely body centered cubic bcc face centered cubic fcc and hexagonal close packed hcp . In bcc each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others. In fcc and hcp each atom is surrounded by twelve others but the stacking of the layers differs. Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature. The unit cell for each crystal structure is the smallest group of atoms which has the overall symmetry of the crystal and from which the entire crystalline lattice can be built up by repetition in three dimensions. In the case of the body centered cubic crystal structure shown above the unit cell is made up of the central atom plus one eight of each of the eight corner atoms. The electronic structure of metals means they are relatively good conductors of electricity. Electrons in matter can only have fixed rather than variable energy levels and in a metal the energy levels of the electrons in its electron cloud at least to some degree correspond to the energy levels at which electrical conduction can occur. In a semiconductor like silicon or a nonmetal like sulfur there is an energy gap between the electrons in the substance and the energy level at which electrical conduction can occur. Consequently semiconductors and nonmetals are relatively poor conductors. The elemental metals have electrical conductivity values of from . S cm for manganese to . S cm for silver. In contrast a semiconducting metalloid such as boron has an electrical conductivity . S cm. With one exception metallic elements reduce their electrical conductivity when heated. Plutonium increases its electrical conductivity when heated in the temperature range of around to C. Metals are relatively good conductors of heat. The electrons in a metal s electron cloud are highly mobile and easily able to pass on heat induced vibrational energy. The contribution of a metal s electrons to its heat capacity and thermal conductivity and the electrical conductivity of the metal itself can be calculated from the free electron model albeit this does not take into account the detailed structure of the metal s ion lattice. Taking into account the positive potential caused by the arrangement of the ion cores enables consideration of the electronic band structure and binding energy of a metal. Various mathematical models are applicable the simplest being the nearly free electron model. Metals are usually inclined to form cations through electron loss. Most will react with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various timescales potassium burns in seconds while iron rusts over years . Some others like palladium platinum and gold do not react with the atmosphere at all. The oxides of metals are generally basic as opposed to those of nonmetals which are acidic or neutral. Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO MnO and OsO which have strictly acidic reactions. Painting anodizing or plating metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion. However a more reactive metal in the electrochemical series must be chosen for coating especially when chipping of the coating is expected. Water and the two metals form an electrochemical cell and if the coating is less reactive than the underlying metal the coating actually promotes corrosion. In chemistry the elements which are usually considered to be metals under ordinary conditions are shown in yellow on the periodic table below. The elements shown as having unknown properties are likely to be metals. The remaining elements are either metalloids B Si Ge As Sb and Te being commonly recognised as such or nonmetals. Astatine At is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid it has been predicted to be a metal. It is here shown as a metalloid. Metal Metalloid Nonmetal Unknown properties Background color shows metal metalloid nonmetal trend in the periodic table An alloy is a substance having metallic properties and which is composed of two or more elements at least one of which is a metal. An alloy may have a variable or fixed composition. For example gold and silver form an alloy in which the proportions of gold or silver can be freely adjusted titanium and silicon form an alloy TiSi in which the ratio of the two components is fixed also known as an intermetallic compound . Most pure metals are either too soft brittle or chemically reactive for practical use. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. The aim of making alloys is generally to make them less brittle harder resistant to corrosion or have a more desirable color and luster. Of all the metallic alloys in use today the alloys of iron steel stainless steel cast iron tool steel alloy steel make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low mid and high carbon steels with increasing carbon levels reducing ductility and toughness. The addition of silicon will produce cast irons while the addition of chromium nickel and molybdenum to carbon steels more than results in stainless steels. Other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium titanium copper and magnesium. Copper alloys have been known since prehistory bronze gave the Bronze Age its name and have many applications today most importantly in electrical wiring. The alloys of the other three metals have been developed relatively recently due to their chemical reactivity they require electrolytic extraction processes. The alloys of aluminium titanium and magnesium are valued for their high strength to weight ratios magnesium can also provide electromagnetic shielding. citation needed These materials are ideal for situations where high strength to weight ratio is more important than material cost such as in aerospace and some automotive applications. Alloys specially designed for highly demanding applications such as jet engines may contain more than ten elements. Metals can be categorised according to their physical or chemical properties. Categories described in the subsections below include ferrous and non ferrous metals brittle metals and refractory metals heavy and light metals and base noble and precious metals. The Metallic elements table in this section categorises the elemental metals on the basis of their chemical properties into alkali and alkaline earth metals transition and post transition metals and lanthanides and actinides. Other categories are possible depending on the criteria for inclusion. For example the ferromagnetic metals those metals that are magnetic at room temperature are iron cobalt and nickel. The term ferrous is derived from the Latin word meaning containing iron . This can include pure iron such as wrought iron or an alloy such as steel. Ferrous metals are often magnetic but not exclusively. Non ferrous metals alloys lack appreciable amounts of iron. While nearly all metals are malleable or ductile a few beryllium chromium manganese gallium and bismuth are brittle. Arsenic and antimony if admitted as metals are brittle. Low values of the ratio of bulk elastic modulus to shear modulus Pugh s criterion are indicative of intrinsic brittleness. In materials science metallurgy and engineering a refractory metal is a metal that is extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear. Which metals belong to this category varies the most common definition includes niobium molybdenum tantalum tungsten and rhenium. They all have melting points above C and a high hardness at room temperature. A white metal is any of range of white coloured metals or their alloys with relatively low melting points. Such metals include zinc cadmium tin antimony here counted as a metal lead and bismuth some of which are quite toxic. In Britain the fine art trade uses the term white metal in auction catalogues to describe foreign silver items which do not carry British Assay Office marks but which are nonetheless understood to be silver and are priced accordingly. A heavy metal is any relatively dense metal or metalloid. More specific definitions have been proposed but none have obtained widespread acceptance. Some heavy metals have niche uses or are notably toxic some are essential in trace amounts. All other metals are light metals. In chemistry the term base metal is used informally to refer to a metal that is easily oxidized or corroded such as reacting easily with dilute hydrochloric acid HCl to form a metal chloride and hydrogen. Examples include iron nickel lead and zinc. Copper is considered a base metal as it is oxidized relatively easily although it does not react with HCl. The term noble metal is commonly used in opposition to base metal. Noble metals are resistant to corrosion or oxidation unlike most base metals. They tend to be precious metals often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold platinum silver rhodium iridium and palladium. In alchemy and numismatics the term base metal is contrasted with precious metal that is those of high economic value. A longtime goal of the alchemists was the transmutation of base metals into precious metals including such coinage metals as silver and gold. Most coins today are made of base metals with no intrinsic value in the past coins frequently derived their value primarily from their precious metal content. Chemically the precious metals like the noble metals are less reactive than most elements have high luster and high electrical conductivity. Historically precious metals were important as currency but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities. Gold silver platinum and palladium each have an ISO currency code. The best known precious metals are gold and silver. While both have industrial uses they are better known for their uses in art jewelry and coinage. Other precious metals include the platinum group metals ruthenium rhodium palladium osmium iridium and platinum of which platinum is the most widely traded. The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use but also by their role as investments and a store of value. Palladium and platinum as of fall were valued at about three quarters the price of gold. Silver is substantially less expensive than these metals but is often traditionally considered a precious metal in light of its role in coinage and jewelry. Metals up to the vicinity of iron in the periodic table are largely made via stellar nucleosynthesis. In this process lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers. Heavier metals are not usually formed this way since fusion reactions involving such nuclei would consume rather than release energy. Rather they are largely synthesised from elements with a lower atomic number by neutron capture with the two main modes of this repetitive capture being the s process and the r process. In the s process s stands for slow singular captures are separated by years or decades allowing the less stable nuclei to beta decay while in the r process rapid captures happen faster than nuclei can decay. Therefore the s process takes a more or less clear path for example stable cadmium nuclei are successively bombarded by free neutrons inside a star until they form cadmium nuclei which are unstable and decay to form indium which is nearly stable with a half life times the age of the universe . These nuclei capture neutrons and form indium which is unstable and decays to form tin and so on. n In contrast there is no such path in the r process. The s process stops at bismuth due to the short half lives of the next two elements polonium and astatine which decay to bismuth or lead. The r process is so fast it can skip this zone of instability and go on to create heavier elements such as thorium and uranium. Metals condense in planets as a result of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes and sometimes thereafter as a result of a neutron star merger n thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed. The Earth s crust is made of approximately of metals by weight of which are light metals such as sodium magnesium and aluminium. Nonmetals make up the rest of the crust. Despite the overall scarcity of some heavier metals such as copper they can become concentrated in economically extractable quantities as a result of mountain building erosion or other geological processes. Metals are primarily found as lithophiles rock loving or chalcophiles ore loving . Lithophile metals are mainly the s block elements the more reactive of the d block elements. and the f block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile metals are mainly the less reactive d block elements and the period p block metals. They are usually found in insoluble sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles hence sinking lower into the crust at the time of its solidification the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles. On the other hand gold is a siderophile or iron loving element. It does not readily form compounds with either oxygen or sulfur. At the time of the Earth s formation and as the most noble inert of metals gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high density metallic alloys. Consequently it is a relatively rare metal. Some other less noble metals molybdenum rhenium the platinum group metals ruthenium rhodium palladium osmium iridium and platinum germanium and tin can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth core mantle and crust rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust in small quantities chiefly as chalcophiles less so in their native form . n The rotating fluid outer core of the Earth s interior which is composed mostly of iron is thought to be the source of Earth s protective magnetic field. n The core lies above Earth s solid inner core and below its mantle. If it could be rearranged into a column having a m footprint it would have a height of nearly light years. The magnetic field shields the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere including the ozone layer that limits the transmission of ultraviolet radiation . Metals are often extracted from the Earth by means of mining ores that are rich sources of the requisite elements such as bauxite. Ore is located by prospecting techniques followed by the exploration and examination of deposits. Mineral sources are generally divided into surface mines which are mined by excavation using heavy equipment and subsurface mines. In some cases the sale price of the metal s involved make it economically feasible to mine lower concentration sources. Once the ore is mined the metals must be extracted usually by chemical or electrolytic reduction. Pyrometallurgy uses high temperatures to convert ore into raw metals while hydrometallurgy employs aqueous chemistry for the same purpose. The methods used depend on the metal and their contaminants. When a metal ore is an ionic compound of that metal and a non metal the ore must usually be smelted heated with a reducing agent to extract the pure metal. Many common metals such as iron are smelted using carbon as a reducing agent. Some metals such as aluminium and sodium have no commercially practical reducing agent and are extracted using electrolysis instead. Sulfide ores are not reduced directly to the metal but are roasted in air to convert them to oxides. Metals are present in nearly all aspects of modern life. Iron a heavy metal may be the most common as it accounts for of all refined metals aluminium a light metal is the next most commonly refined metal. Pure iron may be the cheapest metallic element of all at cost of about US . per gram. Its ores are widespread it is easy to refine and the technology involved has been developed over hundreds of years. Cast iron is even cheaper at a fraction of US . per gram because there is no need for subsequent purification. Platinum at a cost of about per gram may be the most ubiquitous given its very high melting point resistance to corrosion electrical conductivity and durability. It is said to be found in or used to produce of all consumer goods. Polonium is likely to be the most expensive metal at a notional cost of about per gram citation needed due to its scarcity and micro scale production. Some metals and metal alloys possess high structural strength per unit mass making them useful materials for carrying large loads or resisting impact damage. Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear torque and deformation. However the same metal can also be vulnerable to fatigue damage through repeated use or from sudden stress failure when a load capacity is exceeded. The strength and resilience of metals has led to their frequent use in high rise building and bridge construction as well as most vehicles many appliances tools pipes and railroad tracks. Metals are good conductors making them valuable in electrical appliances and for carrying an electric current over a distance with little energy lost. Electrical power grids rely on metal cables to distribute electricity. Home electrical systems for the most part are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. The thermal conductivity of metals is useful for containers to heat materials over a flame. Metals are also used for heat sinks to protect sensitive equipment from overheating. The high reflectivity of some metals enables their use in mirrors including precision astronomical instruments and adds to the aesthetics of metallic jewelry. Some metals have specialized uses mercury is a liquid at room temperature and is used in switches to complete a circuit when it flows over the switch contacts. Radioactive metals such as uranium and plutonium are used in nuclear power plants to produce energy via nuclear fission. Shape memory alloys are used for applications such as pipes fasteners and vascular stents. Metals can be doped with foreign molecules organic inorganic biological and polymers. This doping entails the metal with new properties that are induced by the guest molecules. Applications in catalysis medicine electrochemical cells corrosion and more have been developed. Demand for metals is closely linked to economic growth given their use in infrastructure construction manufacturing and consumer goods. During the th century the variety of metals used in society grew rapidly. Today the development of major nations such as China and India and technological advances are fuelling ever more demand. The result is that mining activities are expanding and more and more of the world s metal stocks are above ground in use rather than below ground as unused reserves. An example is the in use stock of copper. Between and copper in use in the U.S. rose from g to g per person. Metals are inherently recyclable so in principle can be used over and over again minimizing these negative environmental impacts and saving energy. For example of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material. Globally metal recycling is generally low. In the International Resource Panel hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme published reports on metal stocks that exist within society and their recycling rates. The authors of the report observed that the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground. They warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells are so low that unless future end of life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology. Some metals are either essential nutrients typically iron cobalt and zinc or relatively harmless such as ruthenium silver and indium but can be toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other metals such as cadmium mercury and lead are highly poisonous. Potential sources of metal poisoning include mining tailings industrial wastes agricultural runoff occupational exposure paints and treated timber. Copper which occurs in native form may have been the first metal discovered given its distinctive appearance heaviness and malleability compared to other stones or pebbles. Gold silver and iron as meteoric iron and lead were likewise discovered in prehistory. Forms of brass an alloy of copper and zinc made by concurrently smelting the ores of these metals originate from this period although pure zinc was not isolated until the th century . The malleability of the solid metals led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments tools and weapons. Meteoric iron containing nickel was discovered from time to time and in some respects this was superior to any industrial steel manufactured up to the s when alloy steels become prominent. citation needed The discovery of bronze an alloy of copper with arsenic or tin enabled people to create metal objects which were harder and more durable than previously possible. Bronze tools weapons armor and building materials such as decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper Chalcolithic predecessors. Initially bronze was made of copper and arsenic forming arsenic bronze by smelting naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic. The earliest artifacts so far known come from the Iranian plateau in the th millennium BCE. It was only later that tin was used becoming the major non copper ingredient of bronze in the late rd millennium BCE. Pure tin itself was first isolated in BCE by Chinese and Japanese metalworkers. Mercury was known to ancient Chinese and Indians before BCE and found in Egyptian tombs dating from BCE. The earliest known production of steel an iron carbon alloy is seen in pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia Kaman Kalehyk and are nearly years old dating from BCE. From about BCE sword makers of Toledo Spain were making early forms of alloy steel by adding a mineral called wolframite which contained tungsten and manganese to iron ore and carbon . The resulting Toledo steel came to the attention of Rome when used by Hannibal in the Punic Wars. It soon became the basis for the weaponry of Roman legions their swords were said to have been so keen that there is no helmet which cannot be cut through by them. citation needed n In pre Columbian America objects made of tumbaga an alloy of copper and gold started being produced in Panama and Costa Rica between CE. Small metal sculptures were common and an extensive range of tumbaga and gold ornaments comprised the usual regalia of persons of high status. At around the same time indigenous Ecuadorians were combining gold with a naturally occurring platinum alloy containing small amounts of palladium rhodium and iridium to produce miniatures and masks composed of a white gold platinum alloy. The metal workers involved heated gold with grains of the platinum alloy until the gold melted at which point the platinum group metals became bound within the gold. After cooling the resulting conglomeration was hammered and reheated repeatedly until it became as homogenous as if all of the metals concerned had been melted together attaining the melting points of the platinum group metals concerned was beyond the technology of the day . n from Cold Iron by Rudyard Kipling Arabic and medieval alchemists believed that all metals and matter were composed of the principle of sulfur the father of all metals and carrying the combustible property and the principle of mercury the mother of all metals n and carrier of the liquidity fusibility and volatility properties. These principles were not necessarily the common substances sulfur and mercury found in most laboratories. This theory reinforced the belief that all metals were destined to become gold in the bowels of the earth through the proper combinations of heat digestion time and elimination of contaminants all of which could be developed and hastened through the knowledge and methods of alchemy. n Arsenic zinc antimony and bismuth became known although these were at first called semimetals or bastard metals on account of their immalleability. All four may have been used incidentally in earlier times without recognising their nature. Albertus Magnus is believed to have been the first to isolate arsenic from a compound in by heating soap together with arsenic trisulfide. Metallic zinc which is brittle if impure was isolated in India by AD. The first description of a procedure for isolating antimony is in the book De la pirotechnia by Vannoccio Biringuccio. Bismuth was described by Agricola in De Natura Fossilium c. it had been confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements. The first systematic text on the arts of mining and metallurgy was De la Pirotechnia by Vannoccio Biringuccio which treats the examination fusion and working of metals. Sixteen years later Georgius Agricola published De Re Metallica in a clear and complete account of the profession of mining metallurgy and the accessory arts and sciences as well as qualifying as the greatest treatise on the chemical industry through the sixteenth century. He gave the following description of a metal in his De Natura Fossilium Metal is a mineral body by nature either liquid or somewhat hard. The latter may be melted by the heat of the fire but when it has cooled down again and lost all heat it becomes hard again and resumes its proper form. In this respect it differs from the stone which melts in the fire for although the latter regain its hardness yet it loses its pristine form and properties. Traditionally there are six different kinds of metals namely gold silver copper iron tin and lead. There are really others for quicksilver is a metal although the Alchemists disagree with us on this subject and bismuth is also. The ancient Greek writers seem to have been ignorant of bismuth wherefore Ammonius rightly states that there are many species of metals animals and plants which are unknown to us. Stibium when smelted in the crucible and refined has as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is accorded to lead by writers. If when smelted a certain portion be added to tin a bookseller s alloy is produced from which the type is made that is used by those who print books on paper. Each metal has its own form which it preserves when separated from those metals which were mixed with it. Therefore neither electrum nor Stannum not meaning our tin is of itself a real metal but rather an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of gold and silver Stannum of lead and silver. And yet if silver be parted from the electrum then gold remains and not electrum if silver be taken away from Stannum then lead remains and not Stannum. Whether brass however is found as a native metal or not cannot be ascertained with any surety. We only know of the artificial brass which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the mineral calamine. And yet if any should be dug up it would be a proper metal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind. Metal therefore is by nature either solid as I have stated or fluid as in the unique case of quicksilver. But enough now concerning the simple kinds. Platinum the third precious metal after gold and silver was discovered in Ecuador during the period to by the Spanish astronomer Antonio de Ulloa and his colleague the mathematician Jorge Juan y Santacilia. Ulloa was the first person to write a scientific description of the metal in . In the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth was able to isolate an oxide of uranium which he thought was the metal itself. Klaproth was subsequently credited as the discoverer of uranium. It was not until that the French chemist Eugne Melchior Pligot was able to prepare the first sample of uranium metal. Henri Becquerel subsequently discovered radioactivity in by using uranium. In the s Joseph Priestley and the Dutch chemist Martinus van Marum observed the transformative action of metal surfaces on the dehydrogenation of alcohol a development which subsequently led in to the industrial scale synthesis of sulphuric acid using a platinum catalyst. In cerium was the first of the lanthanide metals to be discovered in Bastns Sweden by Jns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. The lanthanide metals were largely regarded as oddities until the s when methods were developed to more efficiently separate them from one another. They have subsequently found uses in cell phones magnets lasers lighting batteries catalytic converters and in other applications enabling modern technologies. Other metals discovered and prepared during this time were cobalt nickel manganese molybdenum tungsten and chromium and some of the platinum group metals palladium osmium iridium and rhodium. All metals discovered until had relatively high densities their heaviness was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion. From onwards light metals such as sodium potassium and strontium were isolated. Their low densities challenged conventional wisdom as to the nature of metals. They behaved chemically as metals however and were subsequently recognised as such. Aluminium was discovered in but it was not until that an industrial large scale production method was developed. Prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry everyday items eyeglass frames optical instruments tableware and foil in the s and early th century. Aluminium s ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses at the time. During World War I major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes. The most common metal in use for electric power transmission today is aluminium conductor steel reinforced. Also seeing much use is all aluminum alloy conductor. Aluminium is used because it has about half the weight of a comparable resistance copper cable though larger diameter due to lower specific conductivity as well as being cheaper. Copper was more popular in the past and is still in use especially at lower voltages and for grounding. While pure metallic titanium . was first prepared in it was not used outside the laboratory until . In the s and s the Soviet Union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications as part of programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early s titanium came into use extensively in military aviation particularly in high performance jets starting with aircraft such as the F Super Sabre and Lockheed A and SR . Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in . The first pound of pure scandium metal was produced in . Production of aluminium scandium alloys began in following a U.S. patent. Aluminium scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR. The modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry Bessemer s Bessemer process in the raw material for which was pig iron. His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. The Gilchrist Thomas process or basic Bessemer process was an improvement to the Bessemer process made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus. Due to its high tensile strength and low cost steel came to be a major component used in buildings infrastructure tools ships automobiles machines appliances and weapons. In the Englishmen Clark and Woods patented an alloy that would today be considered a stainless steel. The corrosion resistance of iron chromium alloys had been recognized in by French metallurgist Pierre Berthier. He noted their resistance against attack by some acids and suggested their use in cutlery. Metallurgists of the th century were unable to produce the combination of low carbon and high chromium found in most modern stainless steels and the high chromium alloys they could produce were too brittle to be practical. It was not until that the industrialisation of stainless steel alloys occurred in England Germany and the United States. By three metals with atomic numbers less than lead the heaviest stable metal remained to be discovered elements . Von Welsbach in proved that the old ytterbium also contained a new element which he named cassiopeium. Urbain proved this simultaneously but his samples were very impure and only contained trace quantities of the new element. Despite this his chosen name lutetium was adopted. In Ogawa found element in thorianite but assigned it as element instead of and named it nipponium. In Walter Noddack Ida Eva Tacke and Otto Berg announced its separation from gadolinite and gave it the present name rhenium. Georges Urbain claimed to have found element in rare earth residues while Vladimir Vernadsky independently found it in orthite. Neither claim was confirmed due to World War I and neither could be confirmed later as the chemistry they reported does not match that now known for hafnium. After the war in Coster and Hevesy found it by X ray spectroscopic analysis in Norwegian zircon. Hafnium was thus the last stable element to be discovered. By the end of World War II scientists had synthesized four post uranium elements all of which are radioactive unstable metals neptunium in plutonium and curium and americium representing elements to . The first two of these were eventually found in nature as well. Curium and americium were by products of the Manhattan project which produced the world s first atomic bomb in . The bomb was based on the nuclear fission of uranium a metal first thought to have been discovered nearly years earlier. Superalloys composed of combinations of Fe Ni Co and Cr and lesser amounts of W Mo Ta Nb Ti and Al were developed shortly after World War II for use in high performance engines operating at elevated temperatures above C F . They retain most of their strength under these conditions for prolonged periods and combine good low temperature ductility with resistance to corrosion or oxidation. Superalloys can now be found in a wide range of applications including land maritime and aerospace turbines and chemical and petroleum plants. The successful development of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II sparked further efforts to synthesize new elements nearly all of which are or are expected to be metals and all of which are radioactive. It was not until that element berkelium next after element curium was synthesized by firing alpha particles at an americium target. In element fermium was found in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion hydrogen a nonmetal had been identified as an element nearly years earlier. Since elements mendelevium to tennessine have been synthesized. The most recently synthesized element is oganneson . Its status as a metal or a nonmetal or something else is not yet clear. A metallic glass also known as an amorphous or glassy metal is a solid metallic material usually an alloy with disordered atomic scale structure. Most pure and alloyed metals in their solid state have atoms arranged in a highly ordered crystalline structure. Amorphous metals have a non crystalline glass like structure. But unlike common glasses such as window glass which are typically electrical insulators amorphous metals have good electrical conductivity. Amorphous metals are produced in several ways including extremely rapid cooling physical vapor deposition solid state reaction ion irradiation and mechanical alloying. The first reported metallic glass was an alloy AuSi produced at Caltech in . More recently batches of amorphous steel with three times the strength of conventional steel alloys have been produced. Currently the most important applications rely on the special magnetic properties of some ferromagnetic metallic glasses. The low magnetization loss is used in high efficiency transformers. Theft control ID tags and other article surveillance schemes often use metallic glasses because of these magnetic properties. A shape memory alloy SMA is an alloy that remembers its original shape and when deformed returns to its pre deformed shape when heated. While the shape memory effect had been first observed in in an Au Cd alloy it was not until with the accidental discovery of the effect in a Ni Ti alloy that research began in earnest and another ten years before commercial applications emerged. SMA s have applications in robotics and automotive aerospace and biomedical industries. There is another type of SMA called a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy FSMA that changes shape under strong magnetic fields. These materials are of particular interest as the magnetic response tends to be faster and more efficient than temperature induced responses. In Israeli chemist Dan Shechtman found an aluminium manganese alloy having five fold symmetry in breach of crystallographic convention at the time which said that crystalline structures could only have two three four or six fold symmetry. Due to fear of the scientific community s reaction it took him two years to publish the results for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in . Since this time hundreds of quasicrystals have been reported and confirmed. They exist in many metallic alloys and some polymers . Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminium alloys Al Li Cu Al Mn Si Al Ni Co Al Pd Mn Al Cu Fe Al Cu V etc. but numerous other compositions are also known Cd Yb Ti Zr Ni Zn Mg Ho Zn Mg Sc In Ag Yb Pd U Si etc. . Quasicrystals effectively have infinitely large unit cells. Icosahedrite AlCuFe the first quasicrystal found in nature was discovered in . Most quasicrystals have ceramic like properties including low electrical conductivity approaching values seen in insulators and low thermal conductivity high hardness brittleness and resistance to corrosion and non stick properties. Quasicrystals have been used to develop heat insulation LEDs diesel engines and new materials that convert heat to electricity. New applications may take advantage of the low coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong hard wearing low friction plastic gears. Other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion broad wavelength reflectors and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility low friction and corrosion resistance are required. Complex metallic alloys CMAs are intermetallic compounds characterized by large unit cells comprising some tens up to thousands of atoms the presence of well defined clusters of atoms frequently with icosahedral symmetry and partial disorder within their crystalline lattices. They are composed of two or more metallic elements sometimes with metalloids or chalcogenides added. They include for example NaCd with sodium atoms and cadmium atoms in the unit cell. Linus Pauling attempted to describe the structure of NaCd in but did not succeed until . At first called giant unit cell crystals interest in CMAs as they came to be called did not pick up until with the publication of a paper called Structurally Complex Alloy Phases given at the th International Conference on Quasicrystals. Potential applications of CMAs include as heat insulation solar heating magnetic refrigerators using waste heat to generate electricity and coatings for turbine blades in military engines. High entropy alloys HEAs such as AlLiMgScTi are composed of equal or nearly equal quantities of five or more metals. Compared to conventional alloys with only one or two base metals HEAs have considerably better strength to weight ratios higher tensile strength and greater resistance to fracturing corrosion and oxidation. Although HEAs were described as early as significant interest did not develop until the s they continue to be the focus of research in materials science and engineering because of their potential for desirable properties. In a MAX phase alloy M is an early transition metal A is an A group element mostly group IIIA and IVA or groups and and X is either carbon or nitrogen. Examples are HfSnC and TiAlN. Such alloys have some of the best properties of metals and ceramics. These properties include high electrical and thermal conductivity thermal shock resistance damage tolerance machinability high elastic stiffness and low thermal expansion coefficients. They can be polished to a metallic luster because of their excellent electrical conductivities. During mechanical testing it has been found that polycrystalline TiSiC cylinders can be repeatedly compressed at room temperature up to stresses of GPa and fully recover upon the removal of the load. Some MAX phases are also highly resistant to chemical attack e.g. TiSiC and high temperature oxidation in air TiAlC CrAlC and TiAlC . Potential applications for MAX phase alloys include as tough machinable thermal shock resistant refractories high temperature heating elements coatings for electrical contacts and neutron irradiation resistant parts for nuclear applications. While MAX phase alloys were discovered in the s the first paper on the subject was not published until .",FALSE

They are unicellular species which exist individually or in chains or groups. Depending on the species their sizes can range from a few micrometers m to a few hundred micrometers. Unlike higher plants microalgae do not have roots stems or leaves. They are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces. Microalgae capable of performing photosynthesis are important for life on earth they produce approximately half of the atmospheric oxygen and use simultaneously the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically. Microalgae together with bacteria form the base of the food web and provide energy for all the trophic levels above them. Microalgae biomass is often measured with chlorophyll a concentrations and can provide a useful index of potential production. The standing stock of microphytes is closely related to that of its predators. Without grazing pressures the standing stock of microphytes dramatically decreases. The biodiversity of microalgae is enormous and they represent an almost untapped resource. It has been estimated that about species in many different genera exist of which about species are described. Over novel compounds originating from algal biomass have been chemically determined. Most of these microalgae species produce unique products like carotenoids antioxidants fatty acids enzymes polymers peptides toxins and sterols. The chemical composition of microalgae is not an intrinsic constant factor but varies over a wide range both depending on species and on cultivation conditions. Some microalgae have the capacity to acclimate to changes in environmental conditions by altering their chemical composition in response to environmental variability. A particularly dramatic example is their ability to replace phospholipids with non phosphorus membrane lipids in P depleted environments. It is possible to accumulate the desired products in microalgae to a large extent by changing environmental factors like temperature illumination pH CO supply salt and nutrients. Microphytes also produce chemical signals which contribute to prey selection defense and avoidance. These chemical signals affect large scale tropic structures such as algal blooms but propagate by simple diffusion and laminar advective flow. Microalgae such as microphytes constitute the basic foodstuff for numerous aquaculture species especially filtering bivalves. Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic microbes can also form symbiotic relationships with host organisms. They provide them with vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids necessary for the growth of the bivalves which are unable to synthesize it themselves. In addition because the cells grow in aqueous suspension they have more efficient access to water CO and other nutrients. Microalgae play a major role in nutrient cycling and fixing inorganic carbon into organic molecules. While fish oil has become famous for its omega fatty acid content fish don t actually produce omega s instead accumulating their omega reserves by consuming microalgae. These omega fatty acids can be obtained in the human diet directly from the microalgae that produce them. A range of microalgae species are produced in hatcheries and are used in a variety of ways for commercial purposes. Studies have estimated the main factors in the success of a microalgae hatchery system to be",FALSE
"68",68,"reverse logistics","/wiki/Reverse_logistics",TRUE,0,"material|material|product|","Reverse logistics is for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials","Reverse logistics is for all operations related to the reuse of products and materials. It is the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value or proper disposal. Remanufacturing and refurbishing activities also may be included in the definition of reverse logistics. Growing green concerns and advancement of green supply chain management concepts and practices make it all the more relevant. The number of publications on the topic of reverse logistics have increased significantly over the past two decades. The first use of the term reverse logistics in a publication was by James R. Stock in a White Paper titled Reverse Logistics published by the Council of Logistics Management in . The concept was further refined in subsequent publications by Stock in another Council of Logistics Management book titled Development and Implementation of Reverse Logistics Programs and by Rogers and Tibben Lembke in a book published by the Reverse Logistics Association titled Going Backwards Reverse Logistics Trends and Practices. The reverse logistics process includes the management and the sale of surplus as well as returned equipment and machines from the hardware leasing business. Normally logistics deal with events that bring the product towards the customer. In the case of reverse logistics the resource goes at least one step back in the supply chain. For instance goods move from the customer to the distributor or to the manufacturer. When a manufacturer s product normally moves through the supply chain network it is to reach the distributor or customer. Any process or management after the delivery of the product involves reverse logistics. If the product is defective the customer would return the product. The manufacturing firm would then have to organise shipping of the defective product testing the product dismantling repairing recycling or disposing the product. The product would travel in reverse through the supply chain network in order to retain any use from the defective product. The logistics for such matters is reverse logistics. In today s marketplace many retailers treat merchandise returns as individual disjointed transactions. The challenge for retailers and vendors is to process returns at a proficiency level that allows quick efficient and cost effective collection and return of merchandise. Customer requirements facilitate demand for a high standard of service that includes accuracy and timeliness. It s the logistic company s responsibility to shorten the link from return origination to the time of resell. By following returns management best practices retailers can achieve a returns process that addresses both the operational and customer retention issues associated with merchandise returns. Further because of the connection between reverse logistics and customer retention it has become a key component within Service Lifecycle Management SLM a business strategy aimed at retaining customers by bundling even more coordination of a company s services data together to achieve greater efficiency in its operations. Reverse logistics is more than just returns management it is activities related to returns avoidance gatekeeping disposal and all other after market supply chain issues . Returns management increasingly being recognized as affecting competitive positioning provides an important link between marketing and logistics. The broad nature of its cross functional impact suggests that firms would benefit by improving internal integration efforts. In particular a firm s ability to react to and plan for the influence of external factors on the returns management process is improved by such internal integration. In a firm s planning for returns a primary factor is the remaining value of the material returning and how to recover that value. Returned goods or elements of the product could even be returned to suppliers and supply chain partners for them to re manufacture . Third party logistics providers see that up to of an enterprise s gross sales are captured by return costs. Almost all reverse logistics contracts are customized to fit the size and type of company contracting. The PL s themselves realize to profits on this business. Studies have shown that an average of to of all retail purchases are returned costing the industry about billion per year. Reverse logistics research has also found that . percent of companies in the United States use secondary market and percent see the secondary market as a competitive advantage. In certain industries goods are distributed to downstream members in the supply chain with the understanding that the goods may be returned for credit if they are not sold e.g. newspapers and magazines. This acts as an incentive for downstream members to carry more stock because the risk of obsolescence is borne by the upstream supply chain members. However there is also a distinct risk attached to this logistics concept. The downstream member in the supply chain might exploit the situation by ordering more stock than is required and returning large volumes. In this way the downstream partner is able to offer high level of service without carrying the risks associated with large inventories. The supplier effectively finances the inventory for the downstream member. It is therefore important to analyze customers accounts for hidden costs. Reusable packaging systems require a closed loop logistics system. Examples include reusable pallets bulk boxes such as Euro containers Reusable bottles for milk soda and beer compressed gas cylinders beer kegs etc. In case of e commerce business many websites offer the flexibility of cash on delivery COD to their customers. Sometimes customers refuse the product at the time of delivery as there is no commitment to take the product. Then the logistics service provider follows the process of reverse logistics on the refused cargo. It is also known as Return to Origin RTO . In this process the e commerce company adds the refused cargo to its inventory stock again after proper quality checks per the company s rules. In case of the Demonstration of Products to the client as part of Pre Sales process The Demonstration equipment is sent to the Customer and has to be returned to maintain Revolving Inventory.",FALSE

For example it can be produced as a settled suspension obtained from conventional drinking water treatment as sewage sludge from wastewater treatment processes or as fecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks. The term is also sometimes used as a generic term for solids separated from suspension in a liquid this soupy material usually contains significant quantities of interstitial water between the solid particles . Sludge can consist of a variety of particles such as animal manure. Industrial wastewater treatment plants produce solids that are also referred to as sludge. This can be generated from biological or physical chemical processes.

"70",70,"crop residue","/wiki/Crop_residue",FALSE,0,"null","There are two types of agricultural crop residues","There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble stems leaves and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground or burned first. In contrast no till strip till or reduced till agriculture practices are carried out to maximize crop residue cover. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Simple line transect measurements can be used to estimate residue coverage. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks seeds bagasse molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment fertilizers and in manufacturing. Most discussions about the economic value of crop residues focus on the equivalent fertilizer cost of the nutrients within. Although crop residues contain both macro and micro nutrients only values for the macro nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium and sulfur are economically significant. Because of the high carbohydrate content crop residues can be considered as an appropriate feedstock to produce biofuels. Some algorithms have been developed to estimate the potential capacity of biofuel production from agricultural residues. Based on the experimental data obtained from a study that used ethanol organosolv pretreated rice straw to produce biohydrogen using Enterobacter aerogenes the annual global amount of collectable rice straw not total produced straw for biofuel production was estimated about million tonnes that could approximately produce . kilotonnes of hydrogen and . million tonnes of lignin by the proposed organosolv technology and it was found that China contributes to about of global potential capacity to produce biohydrogen from rice straw. Nutrients in most crop residue are not immediately available for crop use. Their release called mineralization occurs over a period of years. The biological processes involved in soil nutrient cycles are complex. As a rough guide cereal straw releases about to per cent of its nutrients and pea residues release about percent of their nutrients by the next year. The speed of mineralization depends on the nitrogen and lignin fiber content soil moisture temperature and degree of mixing with the soil. N is released fairly quickly from residue when the content is higher than . per cent such as in pea residues . In contrast below . per cent such as cereal residue soil available N is fixed called immobilization by the microbes as they decompose the residue. Thus pea residue would have short and long term benefits to soil fertility whereas cereal straw would reduce next year s soil supply of available nutrients. Over time the nutrients fixed by soil microbes and humus are released and available to crops. Nutrients from residue are not fully recovered by crops. Just like fertilizer nutrients nutrients released from crop residue into the soil are susceptible to losses such as leaching N and S denitrification N immobilization N P K and S and fixation P and K . The efficiency of nutrient uptake by crops from fertilizers or residue release is generally thought to be similar. For example about percent recovery of N in the above ground plant in the first year. There is some residual benefit of fertilizers as the crops take up a small amount of the nutrients two and three years later. Fertilizer placement can significantly affect the efficiency of crop uptake. The impact of residue placement buried by tillage or left on the surface in zero tillage on nutrient cycling and efficiency is under study. citation needed Thus the practice of calculating the fertilizer equivalent value of the nutrients in crop residue is a reasonable guide to estimating the partial value of crop residues.",FALSE
"71",71,"biomimicry","/wiki/Biomimetics",TRUE,0,"model|system|model|","Biomimetics or biomimicry is the imitation of the models systems and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems","Biomimetics or biomimicry is the imitation of the models systems and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems. The terms biomimetics and biomimicry derive from Ancient Greek bios life and m m sis imitation from m meisthai to imitate from mimos actor. A closely related field is bionics. Living organisms have evolved well adapted structures and materials over geological time through natural selection. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by biological solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self healing abilities environmental exposure tolerance and resistance hydrophobicity self assembly and harnessing solar energy. One of the early examples of would be biomimicry was the study of birds to enable human flight. Although never successful in creating a flying machine Leonardo da Vinci was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of flying machines . The Wright Brothers who succeeded in flying the first heavier than air aircraft in allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight. During the s the American biophysicist and polymath Otto Schmitt developed the concept of biomimetics . During his doctoral research he developed the Schmitt trigger by studying the nerves in squid attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of nerve propagation. He continued to focus on devices that mimic natural systems and by he had perceived a converse to the standard view of biophysics at that time a view he would come to call biomimetics. .mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden margin em padding px .mw parser output .templatequote .templatequotecite line height .em text align left padding left .em margin top Biophysics is not so much a subject matter as it is a point of view. It is an approach to problems of biological science utilizing the theory and technology of the physical sciences. Conversely biophysics is also a biologist s approach to problems of physical science and engineering although this aspect has largely been neglected. In Jack E. Steele coined a similar term bionics at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as the science of systems which have some function copied from nature or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues . During a later meeting in Schmitt stated Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it I prefer biomimetics ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing or rather I should say despecializing into this area of research. In Schmitt used the term biomimetic in the title one of his papers and by it had found its way into Webster s Dictionary bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in as a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems . Bionic took on a different connotation when Martin Caidin referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel Cyborg which later resulted in the television series The Six Million Dollar Man and its spin offs. The term bionic then became associated with the use of electronically operated artificial body parts and having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices . Because the term bionic took on the implication of supernatural strength the scientific community in English speaking countries largely abandoned it. The term biomimicry appeared as early as . Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author Janine Benyus in her book Biomimicry Innovation Inspired by Nature. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a new science that studies nature s models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems . Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a Model Measure and Mentor and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry. Biomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes. Murray s law which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels has been re derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system. Aircraft wing design and flight techniques are being inspired by birds and bats. Biorobots based on the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals include BionicKangaroo which moves like a kangaroo saving energy from one jump and transferring it to its next jump. Kamigami Robots a children s toy mimic cockroach locomotion to run quickly and efficiently over indoor and outdoor surfaces. Researchers studied the termite s ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their termite mounds in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from . C to C F to F . Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created D images of the mound structure which revealed construction that could influence human building design. The Eastgate Centre a mid rise office complex in Harare Zimbabwe stays cool without air conditioning and uses only of the energy of a conventional building of the same size. In structural engineering the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology EPFL has incorporated biomimetic characteristics in an adaptive deployable tensegrity bridge. The bridge can carry out self diagnosis and self repair. The arrangement of leaves on a plant has been adapted for better solar power collection. Analysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinisator lands on the sheath like perch part of the flower Strelitzia reginae known as Bird of Paradise flower has inspired architects and scientists from the University of Freiburg and University of Stuttgart for the creation of hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment. These bio inspired products is sold under the name Flectofin. Other hingeless bioinspired system includes Flectofold. Flectofold has been inspired from the trapping system developed by the carnivorous plant Aldrovanda vesiculosa. There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of stiffness strength and toughness. Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction transportation energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e. strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from nano to macro scales are both strong and tough. Generally most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. Bone nacre abalone shell teeth the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials. The exceptional resistance to fracture of bone is due to complex deformation and toughening mechanisms that operate at spanning different size scales nanoscale structure of protein molecules to macroscopic physiological scale. Nacre exhibits similar mechanical properties however with rather simpler structure. Nacre shows a brick and mortar llike structure with thick mineral layer . . m of closely packed aragonite structures and thin organic matrix nm . While thin films and micrometer sized samples that mimic these structures are already produced successful production of bulk biomimetic structural materials is yet to be realized. However numerous processing techniques have been proposed for producing nacre like materials. Biomorphic mineralization is a technique that produces materials with morphologies and structures resembling those of natural living organisms by using bio structures as templates for mineralization. Compared to other methods of material production biomorphic mineralization is facile environmentally benign and economic. Freeze casting Ice templating an inexpensive method to mimic natural layered structures was employed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to create alumina Al Si and IT HAP epoxy layered composites that match the mechanical properties of bone with an equivalent mineral organic content. Various further studies also employed similar methods to produce high strength and high toughness composites involving a variety of constituent phases. Recent studies demonstrated production of cohesive and self supporting macroscopic tissue constructs that mimic living tissues by printing tens of thousands of heterologous picoliter droplets in software defined D millimeter scale geometries. Efforts are also taken up to mimic the design of nacre in artificial composite materials using fused deposition modelling and the helicoidal structures of stomatopod clubs in the fabrication of high performance carbon fiber epoxy composites. Various established and novel additive manufacturing technologies like PolyJet printing direct ink writing D magnetic printing multi material magnetically assisted D printing and magnetically assisted slip casting have also been utilized to mimic the complex micro scale architectures of natural materials and provide huge scope for future research. Spider web silk is as strong as the Kevlar used in bulletproof vests. Engineers could in principle use such a material if it could be reengineered to have a long enough life for parachute lines suspension bridge cables artificial ligaments for medicine and other purposes. The self sharpening teeth of many animals have been copied to make better cutting tools. New ceramics that exhibit giant electret hysteresis have also been realized. In general in biological systems self healing occurs via chemical signals released at the site of fracture which initiate a systemic response that transport repairing agents to the fracture site thereby promoting autonomic healing. To demonstrate the use of micro vascular networks for autonomic healing researchers developed a microvascular coating substrate architecture that mimics human skin. Bio inspired self healing structural color hydrogels that maintain the stability of an inverse opal structure and its resultant structural colors were developed. A self repairing membrane inspired by rapid self sealing processes in plants was developed for inflatable light weight structures such as rubber boats or Tensairity constructions. The researchers applied a thin soft cellular polyurethane foam coating on the inside of a fabric substrate which closes the crack if the membrane is punctured with a spike. Self healing materials polymers and composite materials capable of mending cracks have been produced based on biological materials. Surfaces that recreate properties of shark skin are intended to enable more efficient movement through water. Efforts have been made to produce fabric that emulates shark skin. Surface tension biomimetics are being researched for technologies such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic coatings and microactuators. Some amphibians such as tree and torrent frogs and arboreal salamanders are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface. Tire treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of tree frogs. Marine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter tidal zones of wave swept beaches preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes and one component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols. Other research has proposed adhesive glue from mussels. Leg attachment pads of several animals including many insects e.g. beetles and flies spiders and lizards e.g. geckos are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact known as setae. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots boots and tape. Synthetic setae have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives. Biomimetic materials are gaining increasing attention in the field of optics and photonics. There are still little known bioinspired or biomimetic products involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is worth pursuing and might lead to future commercial products. For instance the chiral self assembly of cellulose inspired by the Pollia condensata berry has been exploited to make optically active films. Such films are made from cellulose which is a biodegradable and biobased resource obtained from wood or cotton. The structural colours can potentially be everlasting and have more vibrant colour than the ones obtained from chemical absorption of light. Pollia condensata is not the only fruit showing a structural coloured skin other berries such as Margaritaria nobilis does. These fruits show iridescent colors in the blue green region of the visible spectrum which gives the fruit a strong metallic and shiny visual appearance. The structural colours come from the organisation of cellulose chains in the fruit s epicarp a part of the fruit skin. Each cell of the epicarp is made of a multilayered envelope that behaves like a Bragg reflector. However the light which is reflected from the skin of these fruits is not polarised unlike the one arising from man made replicates obtained from the self assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into helicoids which only reflect left handed circularly polarised light. The fruit of Elaeocarpus angustifolius also show structural colour that come arises from the presence of specialised cells called iridosomes which have layered structures. Similar iridosomes have also been found in Delarbrea michieana fruits. In plants multi layer structures can be found either at the surface of the leaves on top of the epidermis such as in Selaginella willdenowii or within specialized intra cellular organelles the so called iridoplasts which are located inside the cells of the upper epidermis. For instance the rain forest plants Begonia pavonina have iridoplasts located inside the epidermal cells. Structural colours have also been found in several algae such as in the red alga Chondrus crispus Irish Moss . Structural coloration produces the rainbow colours of soap bubbles butterfly wings and many beetle scales. Phase separation has been used to fabricate ultra white scattering membranes from polymethylmethacrylate mimicking the beetle Cyphochilus. LED lights can be designed to mimic the patterns of scales on fireflies abdomens improving their efficiency. Morpho butterfly wings are structurally coloured to produce a vibrant blue that does not vary with angle. This effect can be mimicked by a variety of technologies. Lotus Cars claim to have developed a paint that mimics the Morpho butterfly s structural blue colour. In Qualcomm commercialised an interferometric modulator display technology Mirasol using Morpho like optical interference. In the dressmaker Donna Sgro made a dress from Teijin Fibers Morphotex an undyed fabric woven from structurally coloured fibres mimicking the microstructure of Morpho butterfly wing scales. Holistic planned grazing using fencing and or herders seeks to restore grasslands by carefully planning movements of large herds of livestock to mimic the vast herds found in nature. The natural system being mimicked and used as a template is grazing animals concentrated by pack predators that must move on after eating trampling and manuring an area and returning only after it has fully recovered. Developed by Allan Savory who in turn was inspired by the work of Andr Voisin this method of grazing holds tremendous potential in building soil increasing biodiversity reversing desertification and mitigating global warming similar to what occurred during the past million years as the expansion of grass grazer ecosystems built deep grassland soils sequestering carbon and cooling the planet. Permaculture is a set of design principles centered around whole systems thinking simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and resilient features observed in natural ecosystems. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from regenerative agriculture rewilding community and organizational design and development. Some air conditioning systems use biomimicry in their fans to increase airflow while reducing power consumption. Protein folding has been used to control material formation for self assembled functional nanostructures. Polar bear fur has inspired the design of thermal collectors and clothing. The light refractive properties of the moth s eye has been studied to reduce the reflectivity of solar panels. The Bombardier beetle s powerful repellent spray inspired a Swedish company to develop a micro mist spray technology which is claimed to have a low carbon impact compared to aerosol sprays . The beetle mixes chemicals and releases its spray via a steerable nozzle at the end of its abdomen stinging and confusing the victim. Most viruses have an outer capsule to nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as C they are stable across the pH range . Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires nanotubes and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the tobacco mosaic virus TMV can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. This was demonstrated through the production of platinum and gold nanotubes using TMV as a template. Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon PbS and CdS and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material. A spherical plant virus called cowpea chlorotic mottle virus CCMV has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than .. Above this pH independent pores with diameters about nm begin to exchange substance with the environment. The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in Biomorphic mineralization for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH. Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot semiconductor nanoparticles through a series of pH washes. This is an alternative to the apoferritin cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles. Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.",FALSE
"72",72,"compost","/wiki/Compost",TRUE,0,"matter|process|","Compost k mp st or k mpo st is organic matter that has been decomposed in a process called composting","  Compost k mp st or k mpo st is organic matter that has been decomposed in a process called composting. This process recycles various organic materials otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a soil conditioner the compost . Compost is rich in nutrients. It is used for example in gardens landscaping horticulture urban agriculture and organic farming. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways including as a soil conditioner a fertilizer addition of vital humus or humic acids and as a natural pesticide for soil. In ecosystems compost is useful for erosion control land and stream reclamation wetland construction and as landfill cover see compost uses . At the simplest level the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter also called green waste such as leaves grass and food scraps and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of months. However composting also can take place as a multi step closely monitored process with measured inputs of water air and carbon and nitrogen rich materials. The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or windrows are used. Earthworms and fungi further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function aerobic bacteria and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat carbon dioxide and ammonium. Composting is an aerobic method meaning that it requires the presence of air of decomposing organic solid wastes. It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a humus like material known as compost which is a good fertilizer for plants. Composting requires the following three components human management aerobic conditions development of internal biological heat. Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively Certain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. Active management of the pile e.g. turning is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures Fahrenheit Celsius until the materials are broken down. The most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon nitrogen ratio of about . Hot container composting focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a C N ratio of or less. Above the substrate is nitrogen starved below it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia. Nearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen but amounts vary widely with characteristics noted above dry wet brown green . Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about and dry autumn leaves about depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation. With the proper mixture of water oxygen carbon and nitrogen micro organisms are able to break down organic matter to produce compost. The composting process is dependent on micro organisms to break down organic matter into compost. There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are In addition earthworms not only ingest partly composted material but also continually re create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost. Under ideal conditions composting proceeds through three major phases There are many proponents of rapid composting that attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in to weeks. Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods including smaller more homogenized pieces in the compost controlling carbon to nitrogen ratio C N at to or less and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers suggesting that in fact modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are sceptical that there is a super charged way to get nature to make compost rapidly. citation needed Both sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas. However most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating phytotoxic substances. citation needed An alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation known as bokashi. It retains carbon bonds is faster than decomposition and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material. Composting can destroy pathogens or unwanted seeds. Unwanted living plants or weeds can be discouraged by covering with mulch compost. The microbial pesticides in compost may include thermophiles and mesophiles. Thermophilic high temperature composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens exceptions may include prions . The sanitizing qualities of thermophilic composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens such as with manure. Composting is a process used for resource recovery. It can recycle an unwanted by product from another process a waste into a useful new product. Composting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore valuable landfill space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from municipal solid waste. Co composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered fecal sludge or sewage sludge. Industrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an advanced waste processing system. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with anaerobic digestion or in vessel composting is called mechanical biological treatment. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating biodegradable waste before it enters a landfill reduces global warming from fugitive methane untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill producing landfill gas that contains methane a potent greenhouse gas. On many farms the basic composting ingredients are animal manure generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non traditional bedding materials are also used including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules land availability and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical chemical and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures when mixed with bedding possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials those low in nitrogen preferred such as sawdust or straw. Human excreta can also be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen rich organic material. It can be either composted directly like in composting toilets or indirectly as sewage sludge after it has undergone treatment in a sewage treatment plant. Urine can be put on compost piles or directly used as fertilizer. Adding urine to compost can increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Unlike feces urine does not attract disease spreading flies such as houseflies or blowflies and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens such as parasitic worm eggs. Urine usually does not smell for long particularly when it is fresh diluted or put on sorbents. citation needed Compost can be used as an additive to soil or other matrices such as coir and peat as a tilth improver supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich growing medium or a porous absorbent material that holds moisture and soluble minerals providing the support and nutrients in which plants can flourish although it is rarely used alone being primarily mixed with soil sand grit bark chips vermiculite perlite or clay granules to produce loam. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell. Generally direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of phytotoxins in immature compost that may inhibit germination and the possible tie up of nitrogen by incompletely decomposed lignin. It is very common to see blends of compost used for transplanting seedlings at cotyledon stage or later. Compost can be used to increase plant immunity to diseases and pests. Various approaches have been developed to handle different ingredients locations throughput and applications for the composted product. Industrial scale composting can be carried out in the form of in vessel composting aerated static pile composting vermicomposting or windrow composting. citation needed Vermicompost is the product or process of organic material degradation using various species of worms usually red wigglers white worms and earthworms to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste excluding meat dairy fats or oils bedding materials and vermicast. Vermicast also known as worm castings worm humus or worm manure is the end product of the breakdown of organic matter by species of earthworm. Vermicomposting can also be applied for treatment of sewage sludge. A composting toilet collects human excreta. These are added to a compost heap that can be located in a chamber below the toilet seat. Sawdust and straw or other carbon rich materials are usually added as well. Some composting toilets do not require water or electricity others may. If they do not use water for flushing they fall into the category of dry toilets. Some composting toilet designs use urine diversion others do not. When properly managed they do not smell. The composting process in these toilets destroys pathogens to some extent. The amount of pathogen destruction depends on the temperature mesophilic or thermophilic conditions and composting time. Composting toilets with a large composting container of the type Clivus Multrum and derivations of it are popular in United States Canada Australia New Zealand and Sweden. They are available as commercial products as designs for self builders or as design derivatives which are marketed under various names. Black soldier fly Hermetia illucens larvae are able to rapidly consume large amounts of organic material when kept at around C. Black soldier fly larvae can reduce the dry matter of the organic waste by and convert of the dry matter in the waste to biomass. The resulting compost still contains nutrients and can be used for biogas production or further traditional composting or vermicomposting The larvae are rich in fat and protein and can be used as for example animal feed or biodiesel production. Enthusiasts have experimented with a large number of different waste products. Bokashi is not composting as defined earlier rather an alternative technology. It ferments rather than decomposes the input organic matter and feeds the result to the soil food web rather than producing a soil conditioner . The process involves adding Lactobacilli to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment carbohydrates to lactic acid which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil converting the lactic acid to pyruvate which enables soil life to consume the result. Bokashi is typically applied to food waste from households workplaces and catering establishments because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers bokashi bins typically give a batch size of kilograms accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater. Bokashi offers several advantages The importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated the mass of any ecosystem depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within soil water. Therefore the richer the ecosystem the richer the plants. Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals but these are at odds with the purpose of composting . The practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called hgelkultur in German. It is in effect creating a nurse log that is covered with soil. Benefits of hgelkultur garden beds include water retention and warming of soil. Buried wood acts like a sponge as it decomposes able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the hgelkultur bed. Compost teas are defined as water extracts leached from composted materials. Compost teas are generally produced from adding one volume of compost to volumes of water but there has also been debate about the benefits of aerating the mixture. Field studies have shown the benefits of adding compost teas to crops due to the adding of organic matter increased nutrient availability and increased microbial activity. They have also been shown to have an effect on plant pathogens. Worm Hotels accommodate useful worm in ideal conditions. Organic ingredients intended for composting can also be used to generate biogas through anaerobic digestion. This process stabilizes organic material. The residual material sometimes in combination with sewage sludge can be treated by a composting process before selling or giving away the compost. citation needed There are process and product guidelines in Europe that date to the early s Germany the Netherlands Switzerland and only more recently in the UK and the US. In both these countries private trade associations within the industry have established loose standards some say as a stop gap measure to discourage independent government agencies from establishing tougher consumer friendly standards. The USA is the only Western country that does not distinguish sludge source compost from green composts and by default in the USA of states expect composts to comply in some manner with the federal EPA rule promulgated in for sludge products. Compost is regulated in Canada and Australia as well. Many countries such as Wales and some individual cities such as Seattle and San Francisco require food and yard waste to be sorted for composting San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance . Large scale composting systems are used by many urban areas around the world. Composting as a recognized practice dates to at least the early Roman Empire and was mentioned as early as Cato the Elder s BCE piece De Agri Cultura. Traditionally composting involved piling organic materials until the next planting season at which time the materials would have decayed enough to be ready for use in the soil. The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages from the modern perspective are that space is used for a whole year some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall and disease producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled. Composting was somewhat modernized beginning in the s in Europe as a tool for organic farming. The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in Wels Austria in the year . Early frequent citations for propounding composting within farming are for the German speaking world Rudolf Steiner founder of a farming method called biodynamics and Annie Franc Harrar who was appointed on behalf of the government in Mexico and supported the country to set up a large humus organization in the fight against erosion and soil degradation. In the English speaking world it was Sir Albert Howard who worked extensively in India on sustainable practices and Lady Eve Balfour who was a huge proponent of composting. Composting was imported to America by various followers of these early European movements by the likes of J.I. Rodale founder of Rodale Organic Gardening E.E. Pfeiffer who developed scientific practices in biodynamic farming Paul Keene founder of Walnut Acres in Pennsylvania and Scott and Helen Nearing who inspired the back to the land movement of the s . Coincidentally some of the above met briefly in India all were quite influential in the U.S. from the s into the s. The term composting is used worldwide with differing meanings. Humanure is a portmanteau of human and manure designating human excrement feces and urine that is recycled via composting for agricultural purposes. The term was first used in in a book by Joseph Jenkins that advocates the use of this organic soil amendment. The term humanure is used by compost enthusiasts in the United States but not widely used elsewhere. Because the term humanure has no authoritative definition it is subject to various uses. News reporters may use the term also for sewage sludge or biosolids.",FALSE

It is distinguished from other non cementitious types of concrete all binding some form of aggregate together including asphalt concrete with a bitumen binder which is frequently used for road surfaces and polymer concretes that use polymers as a binder. When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and water the mixture forms a fluid slurry that is easily poured and molded into shape. The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone like material that has many uses. Often additives such as pozzolans or superplasticizers are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials such as rebar embedded to provide tensile strength yielding reinforced concrete. Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials. Its usage worldwide ton for ton is twice that of steel wood plastics and aluminum combined. Globally the ready mix concrete industry the largest segment of the concrete market is projected to exceed billion in revenue by . The word concrete comes from the Latin word concretus meaning compact or condensed the perfect passive participle of concrescere from con together and crescere to grow . Small scale production of concrete like materials was pioneered by the Nabatean traders who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan from the th century BC. They discovered the advantages of hydraulic lime with some self cementing properties by BC. They built kilns to supply mortar for the construction of rubble wall houses concrete floors and underground waterproof cisterns. They kept the cisterns secret as these enabled the Nabataeans to thrive in the desert. Some of these structures survive to this day. In the Ancient Egyptian and later Roman eras builders discovered that adding volcanic ash to the mix allowed it to set underwater. Concrete floors were found in the royal palace of Tiryns Greece which dates roughly to BC. Lime mortars were used in Greece Crete and Cyprus in BC. The Assyrian Jerwan Aqueduct BC made use of waterproof concrete. Concrete was used for construction in many ancient structures. The Romans used concrete extensively from BC to AD a span of more than seven hundred years. During the Roman Empire Roman concrete or opus caementicium was made from quicklime pozzolana and an aggregate of pumice. Its widespread use in many Roman structures a key event in the history of architecture termed the Roman architectural revolution freed Roman construction from the restrictions of stone and brick materials. It enabled revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension. Concrete as the Romans knew it was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of arches vaults and domes it quickly hardened into a rigid mass free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick. Modern tests show that opus caementicium had as much compressive strength as modern Portland cement concrete ca. kg cm MPa psi . However due to the absence of reinforcement its tensile strength was far lower than modern reinforced concrete and its mode of application was also different Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand layering together with the placement of aggregate which in Roman practice often consisted of rubble. Second integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension. The long term durability of Roman concrete structures has been found to be due to its use of pyroclastic volcanic rock and ash whereby crystallization of strtlingite and the coalescence of calcium aluminum silicate hydrate cementing binder helped give the concrete a greater degree of fracture resistance even in seismically active environments. Roman concrete is significantly more resistant to erosion by seawater than modern concrete it used pyroclastic materials which react with seawater to form Al tobermorite crystals over time. The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The Baths of Caracalla in Rome are just one example. Many Roman aqueducts and bridges such as the magnificent Pont du Gard in southern France have masonry cladding on a concrete core as does the dome of the Pantheon. After the Roman Empire collapsed use of concrete became rare until the technology was redeveloped in the mid th century. Worldwide concrete has overtaken steel in tonnage of material used. After the Roman Empire the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced until the technique was all but forgotten between and the th century. From the th century to the mid th century the use of cement gradually returned. The Canal du Midi was built using concrete in . Perhaps the greatest step forward in the modern use of concrete was Smeaton s Tower built by British engineer John Smeaton in Devon England between and . This third Eddystone Lighthouse pioneered the use of hydraulic lime in concrete using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate. A method for producing Portland cement was developed in England and patented by Joseph Aspdin in . Aspdin chose the name for its similarity to Portland stone which was quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset England. His son William continued developments into the s earning him recognition for the development of modern Portland cement. Reinforced concrete was invented in by Joseph Monier. and the first house was built by Franois Coignet in . The first concrete reinforced bridge was designed and built by Joseph Monier in . Famous concrete structures include the Hoover Dam the Panama Canal and the Roman Pantheon. The earliest large scale users of concrete technology were the ancient Romans and concrete was widely used in the Roman Empire. The Colosseum in Rome was built largely of concrete and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world s largest unreinforced concrete dome. Today large concrete structures for example dams and multi story car parks are usually made with reinforced concrete. Concrete is a composite material comprising a matrix of aggregate typically a rocky material and a binder typically Portland cement or asphalt which holds the matrix together. Many types of concrete are available determined by the formulations of binders and the types of aggregate used to suit the application for the material. These variables determine strength density as well as chemical and thermal resistance of the finished product. Aggregate consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix generally a coarse gravel or crushed rocks such as limestone or granite along with finer materials such as sand. A cement most commonly Portland cement is the most prevalent kind of concrete binder. For cementitious binders water is mixed with the dry powder and aggregate which produces a semi liquid slurry that can be shaped typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a chemical process called hydration. The water reacts with the cement which bonds the other components together creating a robust stone like material. Other cementitious materials such as fly ash and slag cement are sometimes added either pre blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component and become a part of the binder for the aggregate. Admixtures are added to modify the cure rate or properties of the material. Mineral admixtures use recycled materials as concrete ingredients. Conspicuous materials include fly ash a by product of coal fired power plants ground granulated blast furnace slag a byproduct of steelmaking and silica fume a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. Structures employing Portland cement concrete usually include steel reinforcement. Such concrete can be formulated with high compressive strength but always has lower tensile strength. Therefore it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension typically steel rebar. Other materials can also be used as a concrete binder the most prevalent alternative is asphalt which is used as the binder in asphalt concrete. The mix design depends on the type of structure being built how the concrete is mixed and delivered and how it is placed to form the structure. Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete mortar and many plasters. British masonry worker Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement in . It was named because of the similarity of its color to Portland limestone quarried from the English Isle of Portland and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates alite belite aluminates and ferrites compounds which combine calcium silicon aluminum and iron in forms which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating limestone a source of calcium with clay or shale a source of silicon aluminum and iron and grinding this product called clinker with a source of sulfate most commonly gypsum . In modern cement kilns many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced. Cement kilns are extremely large complex and inherently dusty industrial installations and have emissions which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require . to . gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then grind it into cement. Many kilns can be fueled with difficult to dispose of wastes the most common being used tires. The extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult to use fuels. Combining water with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together fills voids within it and makes it flow more freely. As stated by Abrams law a lower water to cement ratio yields a stronger more durable concrete whereas more water gives a freer flowing concrete with a higher slump. Impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure. Hydration involves many different reactions often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass. Reaction Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. Sand natural gravel and crushed stone are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates from construction demolition and excavation waste are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates while a number of manufactured aggregates including air cooled blast furnace slag and bottom ash are also permitted. The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required. Aggregate with a very even size distribution has the biggest gaps whereas adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these gaps. The binder must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as paste the surfaces of the aggregate together and is typically the most expensive component. Thus variation in sizes of the aggregate reduces the cost of concrete. The aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder so its use does not negatively affect the strength of the concrete. Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients. Decorative stones such as quartzite small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative exposed aggregate finish popular among landscape designers. In addition to being decorative exposed aggregate may add robustness to a concrete. Concrete is strong in compression as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load. However it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack allowing the structure to fail. Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars steel fibers glass fibers or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads. Admixtures are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. Admixtures are defined as additions made as the concrete mix is being prepared . The most common admixtures are retarders and accelerators. In normal use admixture dosages are less than by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batching mixing. See Production below. The common types of admixtures are as follows Inorganic materials that have pozzolanic or latent hydraulic properties these very fine grained materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete mineral admixtures or as a replacement for Portland cement blended cements . Products which incorporate limestone fly ash blast furnace slag and other useful materials with pozzolanic properties into the mix are being tested and used. This development is due to cement production being one of the largest producers at about to of global greenhouse gas emissions as well as lowering costs improving concrete properties and recycling wastes. Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients water aggregate cement and any additives to produce concrete. Concrete production is time sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a concrete plant or often a batch plant. In general usage concrete plants come in two main types ready mix plants and central mix plants. A ready mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water. A central mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements of the amount of water added but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used since hydration begins at the plant. A concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments machinery to accurately weigh move and mix some or all of those ingredients and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete often to a concrete mixer truck. Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid so that it may be poured into forms which are containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape. Concrete formwork can be prepared in several ways such as slip forming and steel plate construction. Alternatively concrete can be mixed into dryer non fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture precast concrete products. A wide variety of equipment is used for processing concrete from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery. Whichever equipment builders use however the objective is to produce the desired building material ingredients must be properly mixed placed shaped and retained within time constraints. Any interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a cold joint between the two batches. Once the mix is where it should be the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product. Thorough mixing is essential to produce uniform high quality concrete. Separate paste mixing has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with aggregates can increase the compressive strength of the resulting concrete. The paste is generally mixed in a high speed shear type mixer at a w cm water to cement ratio of . to . by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders superplasticizers pigments or silica fume. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment. Workability is the ability of a fresh plastic concrete mix to fill the form mold properly with the desired work vibration and without reducing the concrete s quality. Workability depends on water content aggregate shape and size distribution cementitious content and age level of hydration and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates when the cement and aggregates start to separate with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades or using too little or too much sand for the same reason or using too little water or too much cement or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh i.e. which does not flow or spread out smoothly is difficult to get into the formwork and which is difficult to surface finish. Workability can be measured by the concrete slump test a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the ASTM C or EN test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an Abrams cone with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level non absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off the enclosed material slumps a certain amount owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little having a slump value of one or two inches or mm out of one foot mm . A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the flow table test. Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or superplasticizer without changing the water cement ratio. Some other admixtures especially air entraining admixture can increase the slump of a mix. High flow concrete like self consolidating concrete is tested by other flow measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted. After mixing concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed. Concrete must be kept moist during curing in order to achieve optimal strength and durability. During curing hydration occurs allowing calcium silicate hydrate C S H to form. Over of a mix s final strength is typically reached within four weeks with the remaining achieved over years or even decades. The conversion of calcium hydroxide in the concrete into calcium carbonate from absorption of CO over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. This carbonation reaction however lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the reinforcement bars. Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High early strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes increases for up to three years. It depends on cross section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short cut polymer fibers can improve reduce shrinkage induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength. Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the exothermic setting of cement. Improper curing can cause scaling reduced strength poor abrasion resistance and cracking. During the curing period concrete is ideally maintained at controlled temperature and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing concrete slabs are often sprayed with curing compounds that create a water retaining film over the concrete. Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic compounds. After the concrete is sufficiently cured the film is allowed to abrade from the concrete through normal use. Traditional conditions for curing involve by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water. The adjacent picture shows one of many ways to achieve this ponding submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to prevent dehydration. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete. For higher strength applications accelerated curing techniques may be applied to the concrete. A common technique involves heating the poured concrete with steam which serves to both keep it damp and raise the temperature so that the hydration process proceeds more quickly and more thoroughly. Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate cement water and little to no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as no fines or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totaling approximately to percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze thaw climates to minimize the possibility of frost damage. Nanoconcrete contains Portland cement particles that are no greater than m. It is a product of high energy mixing HEM of cement sand and water. To ensure the mixing is thorough enough to create nanoconcrete the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of watts per kilogram of the mix. This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least joules per kilogram of the mix. irrelevant citation and may be increased to kJ per kilogram. A superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation and absorption of energy by the mixture and increases shear stresses on the surface of cement particles. As a result the temperature of the mixture increases by degrees Celsius. This intense mixing serves to deepen hydration process inside the cement particles. The nano sized colloid Calcium Silicate Hydrate C S H formation increased several times compared with conventional mixing. Thus the ordinary concrete transforms to nanoconcrete. The initial natural process of cement hydration with formation of colloidal globules about nm in diameter spreads into the entire volume of cement water matrix as the energy expended upon the mix. The liquid activated high energy mixture can be used by itself for casting small architectural details and decorative items or foamed expanded for lightweight concrete. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions because the liquid phase inside the nano pores of C S H gel doesn t freeze at temperatures from to degrees Celsius. The increased volume of gel reduces capillarity in solid and porous materials. Bacteria such as Bacillus pasteurii Bacillus pseudofirmus Bacillus cohnii Sporosarcina pasteuri and Arthrobacter crystallopoietes increase the compression strength of concrete through their biomass. Not all bacteria increase the strength of concrete significantly with their biomass. Bacillus sp. CT . can reduce corrosion of reinforcement in reinforced concrete by up to four times. Sporosarcina pasteurii reduces water and chloride permeability. B. pasteurii increases resistance to acid. Bacillus pasteurii and B. sphaericuscan induce calcium carbonate precipitation in the surface of cracks adding compression strength. Polymer concretes are mixtures of aggregate and any of various polymers and may be reinforced. The cement is costlier than lime based cements but polymer concretes nevertheless have advantages they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement and they are largely impervious to water. Polymer concretes are frequently used for repair and construction of other applications such as drains. Grinding of concrete can produce hazardous dust. Exposure to cement dust can lead to issues such as silicosis kidney disease skin irritation and similar effects. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the United States recommends attaching local exhaust ventilation shrouds to electric concrete grinders to control the spread of this dust. In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has placed more stringent regulations on companies whose workers regularly come into contact with silica dust. An updated silica rule which OSHA put into effect Sept. for construction companies restricted the amount of respirable crystalline silica workers could legally come into contact with to micrograms per cubic meter of air per hour workday. That same rule went into effect June for general industry hydraulic fracturing and maritime. It should be noted however that the deadline was extended to June for engineering controls in the hydraulic fracturing industry. Companies which fail to meet the tightened safety regulations can face financial charges and extensive penalties. Concrete has relatively high compressive strength but much lower tensile strength. Therefore it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension often steel . The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long duration forces is prone to creep. Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application. Different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the lower bound compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen as determined by standard test procedures. Different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes. Very low strength MPa psi or less concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight. Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air foams or lightweight aggregates with the side effect that the strength is reduced. For most routine uses MPa psi to MPa psi concrete is often used. MPa psi concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable although more expensive option. Higher strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects. Strengths above MPa psi are often used for specific building elements. For example the lower floor columns of high rise concrete buildings may use concrete of MPa psi or more to keep the size of the columns small. Bridges may use long beams of high strength concrete to lower the number of spans required. Occasionally other structural needs may require high strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid concrete of very high strength may be specified even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads. Strengths as high as MPa psi have been used commercially for these reasons. Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time. Structures made of concrete can have a long service life. Concrete is used more than any other artificial material in the world. As of about . billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year more than one cubic meter for every person on Earth. Due to cement s exothermic chemical reaction while setting up large concrete structures such as dams navigation locks large mat foundations and large breakwaters generate excessive heat during hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects post cooling is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam used a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating. Similar systems are still used depending on volume of the pour the concrete mix used and ambient air temperature the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures. Another approach to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement s thermal byproduct is the use of roller compacted concrete which uses a dry mix which has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement. It is deposited in thick layers as a semi dry material then roller compacted into a dense strong mass. Raw concrete surfaces tend to be porous and have a relatively uninteresting appearance. Many different finishes can be applied to improve the appearance and preserve the surface against staining water penetration and freezing. Examples of improved appearance include stamped concrete where the wet concrete has a pattern impressed on the surface to give a paved cobbled or brick like effect and may be accompanied with coloration. Another popular effect for flooring and table tops is polished concrete where the concrete is polished optically flat with diamond abrasives and sealed with polymers or other sealants. Other finishes can be achieved with chiseling or more conventional techniques such as painting or covering it with other materials. The proper treatment of the surface of concrete and therefore its characteristics is an important stage in the construction and renovation of architectural structures. Prestressed concrete is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in compressive stresses during construction to oppose tensile stresses experienced in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs by better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this. In pre tensioned concrete the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting or for post tensioned concrete after casting. More than miles km of highways in the United States are paved with this material. Reinforced concrete prestressed concrete and precast concrete are the most widely used types of concrete functional extensions in modern days. See Brutalism. Extreme weather conditions extreme heat or cold windy condition and humidity variations can significantly alter the quality of concrete. Many precautions are observed in cold weather placement. Low temperatures significantly slow the chemical reactions involved in hydration of cement thus affecting the strength development. Preventing freezing is the most important precaution as formation of ice crystals can cause damage to the crystalline structure of the hydrated cement paste. If the surface of the concrete pour is insulated from the outside temperatures the heat of hydration will prevent freezing. The American Concrete Institute ACI definition of cold weather placement ACI is In Canada where temperatures tend to be much lower during the cold season the following criteria are used by CSA A. The minimum strength before exposing concrete to extreme cold is psi . MPa . CSA A . specified a compressive strength of . MPa to be considered safe for exposure to freezing. Concrete roads are more fuel efficient to drive on more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving so that a well designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that pervious concrete can be used which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed more pumping is otherwise needed in the water distribution system and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather it is immediately absorbed by the ground. Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources typically manufactured within kilometers of the job site. Similarly relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials although large amounts of CO are produced by the chemical reactions in cement manufacture . The overall embodied energy of concrete at roughly to . megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials. Once in place concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling concrete s thermal mass delivers year round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy efficient building. Insulating concrete forms ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure. Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield for example Fondu fyre can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad. Options for non combustible construction include floors ceilings and roofs made of cast in place and hollow core precast concrete. For walls concrete masonry technology and Insulating Concrete Forms ICFs are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure. Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds hurricanes and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness which results in minimal horizontal movement. However this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces. As discussed above concrete is very strong in compression but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement like other unreinforced masonry structures can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally. These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at risk buildings e.g. school buildings in Istanbul Turkey . Concrete can be damaged by many processes such as the expansion of corrosion products of the steel reinforcement bars freezing of trapped water fire or radiant heat aggregate expansion sea water effects bacterial corrosion leaching erosion by fast flowing water physical damage and chemical damage from carbonatation chlorides sulfates and distillate water . The micro fungi Aspergillus Alternaria and Cladosporium were able to grow on samples of concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the Chernobyl reactor leaching aluminum iron calcium and silicon. The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and social consequences. Some are harmful some welcome and some both depending on circumstances. A major component of concrete is cement which similarly exerts environmental and social effects. The cement industry is one of the three primary producers of carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas the other two being the energy production and transportation industries . Every tonne of cement produced releases one tonne of CO into the atmosphere. As of the production of Portland cement contributed eight percent to global anthropogenic CO emissions largely due to the sintering of limestone and clay at C F . Researchers have suggested a number of approaches to improving carbon sequestration relevant to concrete production. Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to surface runoff which can cause heavy soil erosion water pollution and flooding but conversely can be used to divert dam and control flooding. Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution. Concrete is a contributor to the urban heat island effect though less so than asphalt. Workers who cut grind or polish concrete are at risk of inhaling airborne silica which can lead to silicosis. This includes crew members who work in concrete chipping. The presence of some substances in concrete including useful and unwanted additives can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity. Fresh concrete before curing is complete is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment. Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method for disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to landfills for disposal but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness governmental laws and economic benefits. The world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the Three Gorges Dam in Hubei Province China by the Three Gorges Corporation. The amount of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at million cubic meters over years. The previous record was . million cubic meters held by Itaipu hydropower station in Brazil. The world record for concrete pumping was set on August during the construction of the Parbati Hydroelectric Project near the village of Suind Himachal Pradesh India when the concrete mix was pumped through a vertical height of m ft . The world record for the largest continuously poured concrete raft was achieved in August in Abu Dhabi by contracting firm Al Habtoor CCC Joint Venture and the concrete supplier is Unibeton Ready Mix.

While environmental chemistry focuses on the effects of polluting chemicals on nature green chemistry focuses on the environmental impact of chemistry including technological approaches to preventing pollution and reducing consumption of nonrenewable resources. The overarching goals of green chemistry namely more resource efficient and inherently safer design of molecules materials products and processes can be pursued in a wide range of contexts. Note Modified from ref. to be more general. Note Green chemistry discusses the engineering concept of pollution prevention and zero waste both at laboratory and industrial scales. It encourages the use of economical and Green chemistry emerged from a variety of existing ideas and research efforts such as atom economy and catalysis in the period leading up to the s in the context of increasing attention to problems of chemical pollution and resource depletion. The development of green chemistry in Europe and the United States was linked to a shift in environmental problem solving strategies a movement from command and control regulation and mandated reduction of industrial emissions at the end of the pipe toward the active prevention of pollution through the innovative design of production technologies themselves. The set of concepts now recognized as green chemistry coalesced in the mid to late s along with broader adoption of the term which prevailed over competing terms such as clean and sustainable chemistry . In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency played a significant early role in fostering green chemistry through its pollution prevention programs funding and professional coordination. At the same time in the United Kingdom researchers at the University of York contributed to the establishment of the Green Chemistry Network within the Royal Society of Chemistry and the launch of the journal Green Chemistry. In Paul Anastas who then directed the Green Chemistry Program at the US EPA and John C. Warner then of Polaroid Corporation published a set of principles to guide the practice of green chemistry. The twelve principles address a range of ways to reduce the environmental and health impacts of chemical production and also indicate research priorities for the development of green chemistry technologies. The principles cover such concepts as The twelve principles of green chemistry are Attempts are being made not only to quantify the greenness of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as chemical yield the price of reaction components safety in handling chemicals hardware demands energy profile and ease of product workup and purification. In one quantitative study the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline receives points out of marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an amide using HMDS is only described as adequate with a combined points. Green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology. As nanomaterials are developed the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long term economic viability. citation needed Solvents are consumed in large quantities in many chemical syntheses as well as for cleaning and degreasing. Traditional solvents are often toxic or are chlorinated. Green solvents on the other hand are generally derived from renewable resources and biodegrade to innocuous often a naturally occurring product. Novel or enhanced synthetic techniques can often provide improved environmental performance or enable better adherence to the principles of green chemistry. For example the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Yves Chauvin Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock for the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis with explicit reference to its contribution to green chemistry and smarter production. A review identified three key developments in green chemistry in the field of organic synthesis use of supercritical carbon dioxide as green solvent aqueous hydrogen peroxide for clean oxidations and the use of hydrogen in asymmetric synthesis. Some further examples of applied green chemistry are supercritical water oxidation on water reactions and dry media reactions. citation needed Bioengineering is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms such as shikimate a Tamiflu precursor which is fermented by Roche in bacteria. Click chemistry is often cited citation needed as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry. The concept of green pharmacy has recently been articulated based on similar principles. In Dow Chemical won the Greener Reaction Conditions award for their carbon dioxide blowing agent for polystyrene foam production. Polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation. Seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the United States alone. Traditionally CFC and other ozone depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets presenting a serious environmental hazard. Flammable explosive and in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements but they present their own problems. Dow Chemical discovered that supercritical carbon dioxide works equally as well as a blowing agent without the need for hazardous substances allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO used in the process is reused from other industries so the net carbon released from the process is zero. Addressing principle is the Peroxide Process for producing hydrazine without cogenerating salt. Hydrazine is traditionally produced by the Olin Raschig process from sodium hypochlorite the active ingredient in many bleaches and ammonia. The net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine In the greener Peroxide process hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant and the side product is water. The net conversion follows Addressing principle this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents. Methyl ethyl ketone is used as a carrier for the hydrazine the intermediate ketazine phase separates from the reaction mixture facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent. Addressing principle is a green route to propanediol which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors. It can be produced from renewable precursors via the bioseparation of propanediol using a genetically modified strain of E. coli. This diol is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets. In Cargill Dow now NatureWorks won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their improved method for polymerization of polylactic acid . Unfortunately lactide base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. Lactic acid is produced by fermenting corn and converted to lactide the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient tin catalyzed cyclization. The L L lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable polymer which has some applications including textiles and apparel cutlery and food packaging. Wal Mart has announced that it is using will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks doesn t require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes and results in a high quality polymer that is recyclable and compostable. In Shaw Industries selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks superior adhesion properties dimensional stability and its ability to be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type nylon provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon chemistry is well known and not addressed in first generation production. From its inception EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance health and environmental standpoint. Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through elutriation grinding and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified cradle to cradle design. In Archer Daniels Midland ADM and Novozymes won the Greener Synthetic Pathways Award for their enzyme interesterification process. In response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA mandated labeling of trans fats on nutritional information by January Novozymes and ADM worked together to develop a clean enzymatic process for the interesterification of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The result is commercially viable products without trans fats. In addition to the human health benefits of eliminating trans fats the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water prevents vast amounts of byproducts and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted. In the Outstanding Green Chemistry Accomplishments by a Small Business Award went to BioAmber Inc. for integrated production and downstream applications of bio based succinic acid. Succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products. Traditionally succinic acid is produced from petroleum based feedstocks. BioAmber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering CO rather than emitting it. Several laboratory chemicals are controversial from the perspective of Green chemistry. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a Green Alternatives Wizard to help identify alternatives. Ethidium bromide xylene mercury and formaldehyde have been identified as worst offenders which have alternatives. Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes laboratory scale reaction and purification methods. In the Pharmaceutical Industry both GSK and Pfizer have published Solvent Selection Guides for their Drug Discovery chemists. In The EU put into place the Registration Evaluation Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals REACH program which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe. This regulation ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting authorising uses of specific substances. ECHA the EU Chemicals Agency in Helsinki is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the EU member states. The U.S. law that governs the majority of industrial chemicals excluding pesticides foods and pharmaceuticals is the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA of . Examining the role of regulatory programs in shaping the development of green chemistry in the United States analysts have revealed structural flaws and long standing weaknesses in TSCA for example a report to the California Legislature concludes that TSCA has produced a domestic chemicals market that discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function price and performance. Scholars have argued that such market conditions represent a key barrier to the scientific technical and commercial success of green chemistry in the U.S. and fundamental policy changes are needed to correct these weaknesses. Passed in the Pollution Prevention Act helped foster new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing environmental problems before they happen. In the State of California approved two laws aiming to encourage green chemistry launching the California Green Chemistry Initiative. One of these statutes required California s Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC to develop new regulations to prioritize chemicals of concern and promote the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The resulting regulations took effect in initiating DTSC s Safer Consumer Products Program. Many institutions offer courses and degrees on Green Chemistry. Examples from across the globe are Denmark s Technical University and several in the US e.g. at the Universities of Massachusetts Boston Michigan and Oregon. A masters level course in Green Technology has been introduced by the Institute of Chemical Technology India. In the UK at the University of York University of Leicester Department of Chemistry and MRes in Green Chemistry at Imperial College London. In Spain different universities like the Universidad de Jaume I or the Universidad de Navarra offer Green Chemistry master courses. There are also websites focusing on green chemistry such as the Michigan Green Chemistry Clearinghouse at www.migreenchemistry.org. Apart from its Green Chemistry Master courses the Zurich University of Applied Sciences ZHAW presents an exposition and web page Making chemistry green for a broader public illustrating the principles. There are ambiguities in the definition of green chemistry and in how it is understood among broader science policy and business communities. Even within chemistry researchers have used the term green chemistry to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner i.e. the principles . While not all uses of the term are legitimate see greenwashing many are and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked or confused with related concepts like green engineering environmental design or sustainability in general. The complexity and multifaceted nature of green chemistry makes it difficult to devise clear and simple metrics. As a result what is green is often open to debate. Several scientific societies have created awards to encourage research in green chemistry. ",FALSE

Types of industrial waste include dirt and gravel masonry and concrete scrap metal oil solvents chemicals scrap lumber even vegetable matter from restaurants. Industrial waste may be solid liquid or gaseous. It may be hazardous or non hazardous waste. Hazardous waste may be toxic ignitable corrosive reactive or radioactive. Industrial waste may pollute the air the soil or nearby water sources eventually ending up in the sea. Industrial waste is often mixed into municipal waste making accurate assessments difficult. An estimate for the US goes as high as . billion tons of industrial waste produced every year. Most countries have enacted legislation to deal with the problem of industrial waste but strictness and compliance regimes vary. Enforcement is always an issue. Toxic waste chemical waste industrial solid waste and municipal solid waste are designations of industrial wastes. Sewage treatment plants can treat some industrial wastes i.e. those consisting of conventional pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand BOD . Industrial wastes containing toxic pollutants or high concentrations of other pollutants such as ammonia require specialized treatment systems. See Industrial wastewater treatment . Industrial wastes can be classified on the basis of their characteristics Factories and power plants are typically located near bodies of water due to the need for large amounts of water as an input to the manufacturing process or for equipment cooling. Many areas that are becoming industrialized do not yet have the resources or technology to dispose of waste with lesser effects on the environment. Both untreated and partially treated wastewater are commonly fed back into a near lying body of water. Metals chemicals and sewage released into bodies of water directly affect marine ecosystems and the health of those who depend on the waters as food or drinking water sources. Toxins from the wastewater can kill off marine life or cause varying degrees of illness to those who consume these marine animals depending on the contaminant. Metals and chemicals released into bodies of water affect the marine ecosystems. Effective manners in properly removing waste Wastewater containing nitrates and phosphates often causes eutrophication which can kill off existing life in the water. A Thailand study focusing on water pollution origins found that the highest concentrations of water contamination in the U tapao river had a direct correlation to industrial wastewater. Another obvious effect of industrial waste is air pollution resulting from fossil fuel burning. This affects the lives of many people because this spreads illnesses. Over time this issue that has been widespread. Several environmental issues have a devastating effect on third world countries because they don t have sufficient resources to solve this particular issue. This also effects the quality of soil because farmers have to try and deal with this massive issue. In addition nitrogen dioxide is a common air pollutant found in the air. Air pollutants have a devastating effect on the human population because it causes sicknesses. Ammonia also causes a lot of respiratory problems that can be contracted from the air. Illnesses that can occur from air pollution range from irritation to eyes skin nose or throat. There is also a chance to get Pneumonia or Bronchitis both being very dangerous. Commonly people have reported to have gotten headaches nauseam and dizziness from air pollution. The WHO or The World Health Organization has stated that air pollution is the worst risk in terms of human health. Air pollution has been around for a long time. Indoor air pollution is also a risk for humans. This type of air pollution is caused of the burning of solid fuels mostly from cooking or heating. Main article Water Pollution One of the most devastating effects of industrial waste is water pollution. For most industrial processes heavy amount of water is used which comes in contact with harmful chemicals. These chemicals are usually metals or radioactive material. This heavily effects the environment because most of waste ends up in oceans lakes or rivers. As a result water becomes polluted posing as health hazard to everyone. Farmers rely on this water but if the water is polluted then crops that are produced can become polluted. These effect the health of society because if industrial companies can t clean up their waste this begins to affect the life of humans but also animals. Sea creature s health are affected because their lives become endangered by this polluted water. Water pollution can have devastating effects on the human body with the main ones being infections from bacteria parasites and chemicals. Diseases that humans can be exposed from drinking unsafe water range from cholera typhoid or Giardia. In Thailand the roles in municipal solid waste MSW management and industrial waste management are organized by the Royal Thai Government which is organized as central national government regional government and local government. Each government is responsible for different tasks. The central government is responsible for stimulating regulation policies and standards. The regional governments are responsible for coordinating the central and local governments. The local governments are responsible for waste management in their governed area. However the local governments do not dispose of the waste by themselves but instead hire private companies that have been granted the right from the Pollution Control Department PCD in Thailand. The main companies are Bangpoo Industrial Waste Management Center General Environmental Conservation Public Company Limited GENCO SGS Thailand Waste Management Siam LTD WMS and Better World Green Public Company Limited BWG . These companies are responsible for the waste they have received from their customers before releasing it to the environment burying it. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA provides for federal regulation of solid waste in the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA has issued national regulations regarding the handling treatment and disposal of wastes. EPA has authorized individual state environmental agencies to implement and enforce the RCRA regulations through approved waste management programs. State compliance is monitored by EPA inspections. In the case that waste management guideline standards are not met action against the site which will be taken. Compliance errors may be corrected by enforced cleanup directly by the site responsible for the waste or by a third party hired by that site. Prior to the enactment of the Clean Water Act and RCRA open dumping or releasing wastewater into nearby bodies of water were common waste disposal methods. The negative externalities on human health and environmental health led to the need for such a regulations. The RCRA framework provides specified subsections defining nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials and how each should be properly managed and disposed of. Guidelines for the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste includes the banning of open dumping. Hazardous waste is monitored in a cradle to grave fashion. The EPA now when manages . million tons of solid hazardous and industrial waste. Since establishment the RCRA program has undergone reforms as inefficiencies arise and as waste management evolves. The Clean Air Act United States of and Air Quality Act of was one of the first moves to start legislating air pollution. It also provided a stricter enforcement on interstate air pollution. The clean Air Act of Increased legislation to limit pollution. For example mobile sources such as cars trucks and industrial sources were on watch by the government. This acts goal was to regulate the spread of ozone nitrogen dioxide lead monoxide and sulfur dioxide. These six pollutants were categorized as the most common ones according to EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency . Clean Air Act Amendments of Air quality areas that were under the effect of National Ambient Air Quality Standards the National Ambient Air Quality Standards had increased attention to prevent PSD Prevention of Significant Deterioration . Clean Water Act CWA of protects certain areas from waste. Industrial companies are not able to dump in these areas because they are protected by CWA. These are set in places to watch the quality of water.All of these acts have helped to manage pollution in the United States but there is much progress left. With pollution being the leading cause of death as pointed out by Richard Fuller. With plans that are under progress it will not be cheap to maintain pollution in the United States. Levels of water pollution have increased causing diarrhea infections in infants. It has costed around billion to sustain the quality of air and water in China but if China ignores the quality of water pollution it will worsen. The burning of coal is one the leading causes of air pollution in China forcing people to wear face masks when going in public. Issues from pollution arise from power plants and factories. This was a report from urban residents who are trying to convince the government to help. The government has tried to manage heavy industry. There are multiple different ways of managing industrial waste. At times there needs to be stricter policies for companies who deal with industrial waste. According to an article waste heat is often produced and thrown into the environment. Waste heat is produced by water evaporation by the industry. Fossil fuel can be reduced when waste heat is used by industries for their advantage. Most effort to reduce industrial waste come from lifestyle changes from humans and more enforcement to the environment. In order to improve air quality in London there has been of fund of million pounds. This came from the Our Mayor s Air Quality Fund MAQF . London implemented Emission Low Bus Areas. This helps reduce toxic fumes that are released from vehicles. London is in the same situation as in the United States when it comes to managing pollution.",FALSE
"76",76,"landfill","/wiki/Landfill",TRUE,0,"material|material|waste|","A landfill site also known as a tip dump rubbish dump garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial"," A landfill site also known as a tip dump rubbish dump garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial. Landfill is the oldest form of waste treatment although the burial of the waste is modern historically refuse was simply left in piles or thrown into pits. Historically landfills have been the most common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world. Some landfills are also used for waste management purposes such as the temporary storage consolidation and transfer or processing of waste material sorting treatment or recycling . Unless they are stabilized these areas may experience severe shaking or soil liquefaction of the ground during a large earthquake. Typically operators of well run landfills for non hazardous waste meet predefined specifications by applying techniques to citation needed They can also cover waste usually daily with layers of soil or other types of material such as woodchips and fine particles. During landfill operations a scale or weighbridge may weigh waste collection vehicles on arrival and personnel may inspect loads for wastes that do not accord with the landfill s waste acceptance criteria. Afterward the waste collection vehicles use the existing road network on their way to the tipping face or working front where they unload their contents. After loads are deposited compactors or bulldozers can spread and compact the waste on the working face. Before leaving the landfill boundaries the waste collection vehicles may pass through a wheel cleaning facility. If necessary they return to the weighbridge for re weighing without their load. The weighing process can assemble statistics on the daily incoming waste tonnage which databases can retain for record keeping. In addition to trucks some landfills may have equipment to handle railroad containers. The use of rail haul permits landfills to be located at more remote sites without the problems associated with many truck trips. Typically in the working face the compacted waste is covered with soil or alternative materials daily. Alternative waste cover materials include chipped wood or other green waste several sprayed on foam products chemically fixed bio solids and temporary blankets. Blankets can be lifted into place at night and then removed the following day prior to waste placement. The space that is occupied daily by the compacted waste and the cover material is called a daily cell. Waste compaction is critical to extending the life of the landfill. Factors such as waste compressibility waste layer thickness and the number of passes of the compactor over the waste affect the waste densities. The term landfill is usually shorthand for a municipal landfill or sanitary landfill. These facilities were first introduced early in the th century but gained wide use in the s and s in an effort to eliminate open dumps and other unsanitary waste disposal practices. The sanitary landfill is an engineered facility that separates and confines waste. Sanitary landfills are intended as biological reactors bioreactors in which microbes will break down complex organic waste into simpler less toxic compounds over time. These reactors must be designed and operated according to regulatory standards and guidelines See environmental engineering . Usually aerobic decomposition is the first stage by which wastes are broken down in a landfill. These are followed by four stages of anaerobic degradation. Usually solid organic material in solid phase decays rapidly as larger organic molecules degrade into smaller molecules. These smaller organic molecules begin to dissolve and move to the liquid phase followed by hydrolysis of these organic molecules and the hydrolyzed compounds then undergo transformation and volatilization as carbon dioxide CO and methane CH with rest of the waste remaining in solid and liquid phases. During the early phases little material volume reaches the leachate as the biodegradable organic matter of the waste undergoes a rapid decrease in volume. Meanwhile the leachate s chemical oxygen demand increases with increasing concentrations of the more recalcitrant compounds compared to the more reactive compounds in the leachate. Successful conversion and stabilization of the waste depends on how well microbial populations function in syntrophy i.e. an interaction of different populations to provide each other s nutritional needs. The life cycle of a municipal landfill undergoes five distinct phases Phase I Initial adjustment As the waste is placed in the landfill the void spaces contain high volumes of molecular oxygen O . With added and compacted wastes the O content of the landfill bioreactor strata gradually decreases. Microbial populations grow density increases. Aerobic biodegradation dominates i.e. the primary electron acceptor is O. Phase II Transition The O is rapidly degraded by the existing microbial populations. The decreasing O leads to less aerobic and more anaerobic conditions in the layers. The primary electron acceptors during transition are nitrates and sulphates since O is rapidly displaced by CO in the effluent gas. Phase III Acid formation Hydrolysis of the biodegradable fraction of the solid waste begins in the acid formation phase which leads to rapid accumulation of volatile fatty acids VFAs in the leachate. The increased organic acid content decreases the leachate pH from approximately . to .. During this phase the decomposition intermediate compounds like the VFAs contribute much COD. Long chain volatile organic acids VOAs are converted to acetic acid CHO CO and hydrogen gas H . High concentrations of VFAs increase both the biochemical oxygen demand BOD and VOA concentrations which initiates H production by fermentative bacteria which stimulates the growth of H oxidizing bacteria. The H generation phase is relatively short because it is complete by the end of the acid formation phase. The increase in the biomass of acidogenic bacteria increases the amount of degradation of the waste material and consuming nutrients. Metals which are generally more water soluble at lower pH may become more mobile during this phase leading to increasing metal concentrations in the leachate. Phase IV Methane fermentation The acid formation phase intermediary products e.g. acetic propionic and butyric acids are converted to CH and CO by methanogenic microorganisms. As VFAs are metabolized by the methanogens the landfill water pH returns to neutrality. The leachate s organic strength experessed as oxygen demand decreases at a rapid rate with increases in CH and CO gas production. This is the longest decomposition phase. Phase V Final maturation and stabilization The rate of microbiological activity slows during the last phase of waste decomposition as the supply of nutrients limits the chemical reactions e.g. as bioavailable phosphorus becomes increasingly scarce. CH production almost completely disappears with O and oxidized species gradually reappearing in the gas wells as O permeates downwardly from the troposphere. This transforms the oxidation reduction potential ORP in the leachate toward oxidative processes. The residual organic materials may incrementally be converted to the gas phase and as organic matter is composted i.e. the organic matter is converted to humic like compounds. Landfills have the potential to cause a number of issues. Infrastructure disruption such as damage to access roads by heavy vehicles may occur. Pollution of local roads and water courses from wheels on vehicles when they leave the landfill can be significant and can be mitigated by wheel washing systems. Pollution of the local environment such as contamination of groundwater or aquifers or soil contamination may occur as well. When precipitation falls on open landfills water percolates through the garbage and becomes contaminated with suspended and dissolved material forming leachate. If this is not contained it can contaminate groundwater. All modern landfill sites use a combination of impermeable liners several metres thick geologically stable sites and collection systems to contain and capture this leachate. It can then be treated and evaporated. Once a landfill site is full it is sealed off to prevent precipitation ingress and new leachate formation. However liners must have a lifespan be it several hundred years or more. Eventually any landfill liner could leak so the ground around landfills must be tested for leachate to prevent pollutants from contaminating groundwater. Rotting food and other decaying organic waste creates decomposition gases especially CO and CH from aerobic and anaerobic decomposition respectively. Both processes occur simultaneously in different parts of a landfill. In addition to available O the fraction of gas constituents will vary depending on the age of landfill type of waste moisture content and other factors. For example the maximum amount of landfill gas produced can be illustrated a simplified net reaction of diethyl oxalate that accounts for these simultaneous reactions CHO HO CH CO On average about half of the volumetric concentration of landfill gas is CH and slightly less than half is CO. The gas also contains about molecular nitrogen N less than hydrogen sulfide HS and a low concentration of non methane organic compounds NMOC about ppmv Landfill gases can seep out of the landfill and into the surrounding air and soil. Methane is a greenhouse gas and is flammable and potentially explosive at certain concentrations which makes it perfect for burning to generate electricity cleanly. Since decomposing plant matter and food waste only release carbon that has been captured from the atmosphere through photosynthesis no new carbon enters the carbon cycle and the atmospheric concentration of CO is not affected. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere contributing to climate change. In properly managed landfills gas is collected and flared or recovered for landfill gas utilization. Poorly run landfills may become nuisances because of vectors such as rats and flies which can spread infectious diseases. The occurrence of such vectors can be mitigated through the use of daily cover. Other potential issues include wildlife disruption how dust odor noise pollution and reduced local property values. Gases are produced in landfills due to the anaerobic digestion by microbes. In a properly managed landfill this gas is collected and used. Its uses range from simple flaring to the landfill gas utilization and generation of electricity. Landfill gas monitoring alerts workers to the presence of a build up of gases to a harmful level. In some countries landfill gas recovery is extensive in the United States for example more than landfills have active landfill gas recovery systems. Landfills in Canada are regulated by provincial environmental agencies and environmental protection legislation. Older facilities tend to fall under current standards and are monitored for leaching. Some former locations have been converted to parkland. In the European Union individual states are obliged to enact legislation to comply with the requirements and obligations of the European Landfill Directive. In the UK this is the Waste Implementation Programme. Finland Sweden Denmark Poland Germany the Netherlands Belgium Austria and Slovenia have laws banning or severely restricting the disposal of household trash via landfills. Landfilling practices in the UK have had to change in recent years to meet the challenges of the European Landfill Directive. The UK now imposes landfill tax upon biodegradable waste which is put into landfills. In addition to this the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme has been established for local authorities to trade landfill quotas in England. A different system operates in Wales where authorities are not able to trade between themselves but have allowances known as the Landfill Allowance Scheme. U.S. landfills are regulated by each state s environmental agency which establishes minimum guidelines however none of these standards may fall below those set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA . Permitting a landfill generally takes between five and seven years costs millions of dollars and requires rigorous siting engineering and environmental studies and demonstrations to ensure local environmental and safety concerns are satisfied. The status of a landfill s microbial community may determine its digestive efficiency. Bacteria that digest plastic have been found in landfills. Landfills can be regarded as a viable and abundant source of materials and energy. In the developing world waste pickers often scavenge for still usable materials. In a commercial context landfill sites have also been discovered by companies and many have begun harvesting materials and energy . Well known examples are gas recovery facilities. Other commercial facilities include waste incinerators which have built in material recovery. This material recovery is possible through the use of filters electro filter active carbon and potassium filter quench HCl washer SO washer bottom ash grating etc. . In addition to waste reduction and recycling strategies there are various alternatives to landfills including waste to energy incineration anaerobic digestion composting mechanical biological treatment pyrolysis and plasma arc gasification. Depending on local economics and incentives these can be made more financially attractive than landfills. Countries including Germany Austria Sweden Denmark Belgium the Netherlands and Switzerland have banned the disposal of untreated waste in landfills. citation needed In these countries only certain hazardous wastes fly ashes from incineration or the stabilized output of mechanical biological treatment plants may still be deposited. citation needed",FALSE

Scandium and yttrium are considered rare earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and exhibit similar chemical properties but have different electronic and magnetic properties. Rarely a broader definition that includes actinides may be used since the actinides share some mineralogical chemical and physical especially electron shell configuration characteristics. The rare earth elements are cerium Ce dysprosium Dy erbium Er europium Eu gadolinium Gd holmium Ho lanthanum La lutetium Lu neodymium Nd praseodymium Pr promethium Pm samarium Sm scandium Sc terbium Tb thulium Tm ytterbium Yb and yttrium Y . They are often found in minerals with Thorium Th and less commonly Uranium U . Despite their name rare earth elements are with the exception of the radioactive promethium relatively plentiful in Earth s crust with cerium being the th most abundant element at parts per million more abundant than copper. However because of their geochemical properties rare earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found concentrated in rare earth minerals as a result economically exploitable ore deposits are less common. The first rare earth mineral discovered was gadolinite a mineral composed of cerium yttrium iron silicon and other elements. This mineral was extracted from a mine in the village of Ytterby in Sweden four of the rare earth elements bear names derived from this single location. A table listing the rare earth elements their atomic number and symbol the etymology of their names and their main usages see also Applications of lanthanides is provided here. Some of the rare earth elements are named after the scientists who discovered or elucidated their elemental properties and some after their geographical discovery. The following abbreviations are often used The first rare earth element discovered was the black mineral ytterbite renamed to gadolinite in . It was discovered by Lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius in at a quarry in the village of Ytterby Sweden. Arrhenius s ytterbite reached Johan Gadolin a Royal Academy of Turku professor and his analysis yielded an unknown oxide earth that he called yttria. Anders Gustav Ekeberg isolated beryllium from the gadolinite but failed to recognize other elements ore contained. After this discovery in a mineral from Bastns near Riddarhyttan Sweden which was believed to be an iron tungsten mineral was re examined by Jns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger. In they obtained a white oxide and called it ceria. Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently discovered the same oxide and called it ochroia. Thus by there were two known rare earth elements yttrium and cerium although it took another years for researchers to determine that other elements were contained in the two ores ceria and yttria the similarity of the rare earth metals chemical properties made their separation difficult . In Carl Gustav Mosander an assistant of Berzelius separated ceria by heating the nitrate and dissolving the product in nitric acid. He called the oxide of the soluble salt lanthana. It took him three more years to separate the lanthana further into didymia and pure lanthana. Didymia although not further separable by Mosander s techniques was in fact still a mixture of oxides. In Mosander also separated the yttria into three oxides pure yttria terbia and erbia all the names are derived from the town name Ytterby . The earth giving pink salts he called terbium the one that yielded yellow peroxide he called erbium. So in the number of known rare earth elements had reached six yttrium cerium lanthanum didymium erbium and terbium. Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to separate the crude yttria and found the same substances that Mosander obtained but Berlin named the substance giving pink salts erbium and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide terbium. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine. Due to the difficulty in separating the metals and determining the separation is complete the total number of false discoveries was dozens with some putting the total number of discoveries at over a hundred. There were no further discoveries for years and the element didymium was listed in the periodic table of elements with a molecular mass of . In Delafontaine used the new physical process of optical flame spectroscopy and found several new spectral lines in didymia. Also in the new element samarium was isolated by Paul mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran from the mineral samarskite. The samaria earth was further separated by Lecoq de Boisbaudran in and a similar result was obtained by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac by direct isolation from samarskite. They named the element gadolinium after Johan Gadolin and its oxide was named gadolinia . Further spectroscopic analysis between and of samaria yttria and samarskite by William Crookes Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Eugne Anatole Demaray yielded several new spectroscopic lines that indicated the existence of an unknown element. The fractional crystallization of the oxides then yielded europium in . In the third source for rare earths became available. This is a mineral similar to gadolinite uranotantalum now called samarskite . This mineral from Miass in the southern Ural Mountains was documented by Gustav Rose. The Russian chemist R. Harmann proposed that a new element he called ilmenium should be present in this mineral but later Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand Galissard de Marignac and Heinrich Rose found only tantalum and niobium columbium in it. The exact number of rare earth elements that existed was highly unclear and a maximum number of was estimated. The use of X ray spectra obtained by X ray crystallography by Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley made it possible to assign atomic numbers to the elements. Moseley found that the exact number of lanthanides had to be and that element had yet to be discovered. Using these facts about atomic numbers from X ray crystallography Moseley also showed that hafnium element would not be a rare earth element. Moseley was killed in World War I in years before hafnium was discovered. Hence the claim of Georges Urbain that he had discovered element was untrue. Hafnium is an element that lies in the periodic table immediately below zirconium and hafnium and zirconium are very similar in their chemical and physical properties. During the s Frank Spedding and others in the United States during the Manhattan Project developed the chemical ion exchange procedures for separating and purifying the rare earth elements. This method was first applied to the actinides for separating plutonium and neptunium from uranium thorium actinium and the other actinides in the materials produced in nuclear reactors. The plutonium was very desirable because it is a fissile material. The principal sources of rare earth elements are the minerals bastnsite monazite and loparite and the lateritic ion adsorption clays. Despite their high relative abundance rare earth minerals are more difficult to mine and extract than equivalent sources of transition metals due in part to their similar chemical properties making the rare earth elements relatively expensive. Their industrial use was very limited until efficient separation techniques were developed such as ion exchange fractional crystallization and liquid liquid extraction during the late s and early s. Some ilmenite concentrates contain small amounts scandium and other rare earth elements which could be analysed by XRF . Before the time that ion exchange methods and elution were available the separation of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days the first separation was into two main groups the cerium earths scandium lanthanum cerium praseodymium neodymium and samarium and the yttrium earths yttrium dysprosium holmium erbium thulium ytterbium and lutetium . Europium gadolinium and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare earth elements the terbium group or europium was included in the cerium group and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble those of the terbium group slightly and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group dysprosium holmium erbium and thulium and the ytterbium group ytterbium and lutetium but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups. Today the rare earth elements are classified as light or heavy rare earth elements rather than in cerium and yttrium groups. The classification of rare earth elements is inconsistent between authors. The most common distinction between rare earth elements is made by atomic numbers those with low atomic numbers are referred to as light rare earth elements LREE those with high atomic numbers are the heavy rare earth elements HREE and those that fall in between are typically referred to as the middle rare earth elements MREE . Commonly rare earth elements with atomic numbers to are classified as light and those with atomic numbers greater than corresponding to europium are classified as heavy rare earth elements. Increasing atomic numbers between light and heavy rare earth elements and decreasing atomic radii throughout the series causes chemical variations. Europium is exempt of this classification as it has two valence states Eu and Eu . Yttrium is grouped as heavy rare earth element due to chemical similarities. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Red Book p. recommends that lanthanoid is used rather than lanthanide. The ending ide normally indicates a negative ion. However owing to wide current use lanthanide is still allowed and is roughly analogous to rare earth element. According to Professor of chemistry Andrea Sella rare earth elements differ from other elements insofar that rare earth metals when looked at anatomically seem to be inseparable from each other in that they are all almost exactly the same in terms of their chemical properties. However in terms of their electronic properties their magnetic properties each one is really exquisitely unique and so it can occupy a tiny niche in our technology where virtually nothing else can. For example the rare earth elements Praseodymium Pr and Neodymium Nd can both be embedded inside glass and they completely cut out the glare from the flame when one is doing glass blowing. Rare earth elements except scandium are heavier than iron and thus are produced by supernova nucleosynthesis or by the s process in asymptotic giant branch stars. In nature spontaneous fission of uranium produces trace amounts of radioactive promethium but most promethium is synthetically produced in nuclear reactors. Due to their chemical similarity the concentrations of rare earths in rocks are only slowly changed by geochemical processes making their proportions useful for geochronology and dating fossils. Rare earth element cerium is actually the th most abundant element in Earth s crust having parts per million about as common as copper . Only the highly unstable and radioactive promethium rare earth is quite scarce. The rare earth elements are often found together. The longest lived isotope of promethium has a half life of . years so the element exists in nature in only negligible amounts approximately g in the entire Earth s crust . Promethium is one of the two elements that do not have stable non radioactive isotopes and are followed by i.e. with higher atomic number stable elements the other being technetium . During the sequential accretion of the Earth the dense rare earth elements were incorporated into the deeper portions of the planet. Early differentiation of molten material largely incorporated the rare earths into Mantle rocks. The high field strength and large ionic radii of rare earths make them incompatible with the crystal lattices of most rock forming minerals so REE will undergo strong partitioning into a melt phase if one is present. REE are chemically very similar and have always been difficult to separate but a gradual decrease in ionic radius from LREE to HREE called lanthanide contraction can produce a broad separation between light and heavy REE. The larger ionic radii of LREE make them generally more incompatible than HREE in rock forming minerals and will partition more strongly into a melt phase while HREE may prefer to remain in the crystalline residue particularly if it contains HREE compatible minerals like garnet. The result is that all magma formed from partial melting will always have greater concentrations of LREE than HREE and individual minerals may be dominated by either HREE or LREE depending on which range of ionic radii best fits the crystal lattice. Among the anhydrous rare earth phosphates it is the tetragonal mineral xenotime that incorporates yttrium and the HREE whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the LREE preferentially. The smaller size of the HREE allows greater solid solubility in the rock forming minerals that make up Earth s mantle and thus yttrium and the HREE show less enrichment in Earth s crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the LREE. This has economic consequences large ore bodies of LREE are known around the world and are being exploited. Ore bodies for HREE are more rare smaller and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of HREE originates in the ion absorption clay ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about yttrium oxide with the HREE being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo Harkins rule even numbered REE at abundances of about each and odd numbered REE at abundances of about each. Similar compositions are found in xenotime or gadolinite. Well known minerals containing yttrium and other HREE include gadolinite xenotime samarskite euxenite fergusonite yttrotantalite yttrotungstite yttrofluorite a variety of fluorite thalenite yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon which derives its typical yellow fluorescence from some of the accompanying HREE. The zirconium mineral eudialyte such as is found in southern Greenland contains small but potentially useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. Xenotime is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy sand processing but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite which typically contains a few percent of yttrium . Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct. Well known minerals containing cerium and other LREE include bastnsite monazite allanite loparite ancylite parisite lanthanite chevkinite cerite stillwellite britholite fluocerite and cerianite. Monazite marine sands from Brazil India or Australia rock from South Africa bastnsite from Mountain Pass rare earth mine or several localities in China and loparite Kola Peninsula Russia have been the principal ores of cerium and the light lanthanides. Enriched deposits of rare earth elements at the surface of the Earth carbonatites and pegmatites are related to alkaline plutonism an uncommon kind of magmatism that occurs in tectonic settings where there is rifting or that are near subduction zones. In a rift setting the alkaline magma is produced by very small degrees of partial melting of garnet peridotite in the upper mantle to km depth . This melt becomes enriched in incompatible elements like the rare earth elements by leaching them out of the crystalline residue. The resultant magma rises as a diapir or diatreme along pre existing fractures and can be emplaced deep in the crust or erupted at the surface. Typical REE enriched deposits types forming in rift settings are carbonatites and A and M Type granitoids. Near subduction zones partial melting of the subducting plate within the asthenosphere to km depth produces a volatile rich magma high concentrations of CO and water with high concentrations of alkaline elements and high element mobility that the rare earths are strongly partitioned into. This melt may also rise along pre existing fractures and be emplaced in the crust above the subducting slab or erupted at the surface. REE enriched deposits forming from these melts are typically S Type granitoids. Alkaline magmas enriched with rare earth elements include carbonatites peralkaline granites pegmatites and nepheline syenite. Carbonatites crystallize from CO rich fluids which can be produced by partial melting of hydrous carbonated lherzolite to produce a CO rich primary magma by fractional crystallization of an alkaline primary magma or by separation of a CO rich immiscible liquid from. These liquids are most commonly forming in association with very deep Precambrian Cratons like the ones found in Africa and the Canadian Shield. Ferrocarbonatites are the most common type of carbonatite to be enriched in REE and are often emplaced as late stage brecciated pipes at the core of igneous complexes they consist of fine grained calcite and hematite sometimes with significant concentrations of ankerite and minor concentrations of siderite. Large carbonatite deposits enriched in rare earth elements include Mount Weld in Australia Thor Lake in Canada Zandkopsdrift in South Africa and Mountain Pass in the USA. Peralkaline granites A Type granitoids have very high concentrations of alkaline elements and very low concentrations of phosphorus they are deposited at moderate depths in extensional zones often as igneous ring complexes or as pipes massive bodies and lenses. These fluids have very low viscosities and high element mobility which allows for crystallization of large grains despite a relatively short crystallization time upon emplacement their large grain size is why these deposits are commonly referred to as pegmatites. Economically viable pegmatites are divided into Lithium Cesium Tantalum LCT and Niobium Yttrium Fluorine NYF types NYF types are enriched in rare earth minerals. Examples of rare earth pegmatite deposits include Strange Lake in Canada and Khaladean Buregtey in Mongolia. Nepheline syenite M Type granitoids deposits are feldspar and feldspathoid minerals and are deposited in small circular massifs. They contain high concentrations of rare earth bearing accessory minerals. For the most part these deposits are small but important examples include Illimaussaq Kvanefeld in Greenland and Lovozera in Russia. Rare earth elements can also be enriched in deposits by secondary alteration either by interactions with hydrothermal fluids or meteoric water or by erosion and transport of resistate REE bearing minerals. Argillization of primary minerals enriches insoluble elements by leaching out silica and other soluble elements recrystallizing feldspar into clay minerals such kaolinite halloysite and montmorillonite. In tropical regions where precipitation is high weathering forms a thick argillized regolith this process is called supergene enrichment and produces laterite deposits heavy rare earth elements are incorporated into the residual clay by absorption. This kind of deposit is only mined for REE in Southern China where the majority of global heavy rare earth element production occurs. REE laterites do form elsewhere including over the carbonatite at Mount Weld in Australia. REE may also by extracted from placer deposits if the sedimentary parent lithology contained REE bearing heavy resistate minerals. In Yasuhiro Kato a geologist at the University of Tokyo who led a study of Pacific Ocean seabed mud published results indicating the mud could hold rich concentrations of rare earth minerals. The deposits studied at sites came from h ot plumes from hydrothermal vents pull ing these materials out of seawater and deposit ing them on the seafloor bit by bit over tens of millions of years. One square patch of metal rich mud . kilometers wide might contain enough rare earths to meet most of the global demand for a year Japanese geologists report July in Nature Geoscience. I believe that rare earth resources undersea are much more promising than on land resources said Kato. C oncentrations of rare earths were comparable to those found in clays mined in China. Some deposits contained twice as much heavy rare earths such as dysprosium a component of magnets in hybrid car motors. The application of rare earth elements to geology is important to understanding the petrological processes of igneous sedimentary and metamorphic rock formation. In geochemistry rare earth elements can be used to infer the petrological mechanisms that have affected a rock due to the subtle atomic size differences between the elements which causes preferential fractionation of some rare earths relative to others depending on the processes at work. In geochemistry rare earth elements are typically presented in normalized spider diagrams in which concentration of rare earth elements are normalized to a reference standard and are then expressed as the logarithm to the base of the value. Commonly the rare earth elements are normalized to chondritic meteorites as these are believed to be the closest representation of unfractionated solar system material. However other normalizing standards can be applied depending on the purpose of the study. Normalization to a standard reference value especially of a material believed to be unfractionated allows the observed abundances to be compared to initial abundances of the element. Normalization also removes the pronounced zig zag pattern caused by the differences in abundance between even and odd atomic numbers. The trends that are observed in spider diagrams are typically referred to as patterns which may be diagnostic of petrological processes that have affected the material of interest. The rare earth elements patterns observed in igneous rocks are primarily a function of the chemistry of the source where the rock came from as well as the fractionation history the rock has undergone. Fractionation is in turn a function of the partition coefficients of each element. Partition coefficients are responsible for the fractionation of a trace elements including rare earth elements into the liquid phase the melt magma into the solid phase the mineral . If an element preferentially remains in the solid phase it is termed compatible and it preferentially partitions into the melt phase it is described as incompatible . Each element has a different partition coefficient and therefore fractionates into solid and liquid phases distinctly. These concepts are also applicable to metamorphic and sedimentary petrology. In igneous rocks particularly in felsic melts the following observations apply anomalies in europium are dominated by the crystallization of feldspars. Hornblende controls the enrichment of MREE compared to LREE and HREE. Depletion of LREE relative to HREE may be due to the crystallization of olivine orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene. On the other hand depletion of HREE relative to LREE may be due to the presence of garnet as garnet preferentially incorporates HREE into its crystal structure. The presence of zircon may also cause a similar effect. In sedimentary rocks rare earth elements in clastic sediments are a representation provenance. The rare earth element concentrations are not typically affected by sea and river waters as rare earth elements are insoluble and thus have very low concentrations in these fluids. As a result when a sediment is transported rare earth element concentrations are unaffected by the fluid and instead the rock retains the rare earth element concentration from its source. Sea and river waters typically have low rare earth element concentrations. However aqueous geochemistry is still very important. In oceans rare earth elements reflect input from rivers hydrothermal vents and aeolian sources this is important in the investigation of ocean mixing and circulation. Rare earth elements are also useful for dating rocks as some radioactive isotopes display long half lives. Of particular interest are the La Ce Sm Nd and Lu Hf systems. Until most of the world s rare earths were sourced from placer sand deposits in India and Brazil. Through the s South Africa was the world s rare earth source from a monazite rich reef at the Steenkampskraal mine in Western Cape province. Through the s until the s the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California made the United States the leading producer. Today the Indian and South African deposits still produce some rare earth concentrates but they are dwarfed by the scale of Chinese production. In China produced of the world s rare earth supply mostly in Inner Mongolia although it had only . of reserves. Australia was the second and only other major producer with of world production. All of the world s heavy rare earths such as dysprosium come from Chinese rare earth sources such as the polymetallic Bayan Obo deposit. The Browns Range mine located km south east of Halls Creek in northern Western Australia is currently under development and is positioned to become the first significant dysprosium producer outside of China. Increased demand has strained supply and there is growing concern that the world may soon face a shortage of the rare earths. In several years from worldwide demand for rare earth elements is expected to exceed supply by tonnes annually unless major new sources are developed. In it was stated that the demand for REEs would increase due to the dependence of the EU on these elements the fact that rare earth elements cannot be substituted by other elements and that REEs have a low recycling rate. Furthermore due to the increased demand and low supply future prices are expected to increase and there is a chance that countries other than China will open REE mines. REE is increasing in demand due to the fact that they are essential for new and innovative technology that is being created. These new products that need REEs to be produced are high technology equipment such as smart phones digital cameras computer parts etc. In addition these elements are more prevalent in the following industries renewable energy technology military equipment glass making and metallurgy. These concerns have intensified due to the actions of China the predominant supplier. Specifically China has announced regulations on exports and a crackdown on smuggling. On September China announced plans to reduce its export quota to tons per year in to conserve scarce resources and protect the environment. On October China Daily citing an unnamed Ministry of Commerce official reported that China will further reduce quotas for rare earth exports by percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over exploitation. The government in Beijing further increased its control by forcing smaller independent miners to merge into state owned corporations or face closure. At the end of China announced that the first round of export quotas in for rare earths would be tons which was a decrease from the previous first round of quotas in . China announced further export quotas on July for the second half of the year with total allocation at tons with total production capped at tonnes. In September China announced the halt in production of three of its eight major rare earth mines responsible for almost of China s total rare earth production. In March the US EU and Japan confronted China at WTO about these export and production restrictions. China responded with claims that the restrictions had environmental protection in mind. In August China announced a further reduction in production. These restrictions have damaged industries in other countries and forced producers of rare earth products to relocate their operations to China. The Chinese restrictions on supply failed in as prices dropped in response to the opening of other sources. The price of dysprosium oxide was USD kg in but dropped to US kg by . On August the WTO ruled that China had broken free trade agreements and the WTO said in the summary of key findings that the overall effect of the foreign and domestic restrictions is to encourage domestic extraction and secure preferential use of those materials by Chinese manufacturers. China declared that it would implement the ruling on September but would need some time to do so. By January China had lifted all quotas from the export of rare earths however export licences will still be required. As a result of the increased demand and tightening restrictions on exports of the metals from China some countries are stockpiling rare earth resources. Searches for alternative sources in Australia Brazil Canada South Africa Tanzania Greenland and the United States are ongoing. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the s and it will take a few years to restart production as there are many barriers to entry. One example is the Mountain Pass mine in California which announced its resumption of operations on a start up basis on August . Other significant sites under development outside of China include Steenkampskraal in South Africa the world s highest grade rare earths and thorium mine which is gearing to go back into production. Over of the infrastructure is already complete . Other mines include the Nolans Project in Central Australia the Bokan Mountain project in Alaska the remote Hoidas Lake project in northern Canada and the Mount Weld project in Australia. The Hoidas Lake project has the potential to supply about of the billion of REE consumption that occurs in North America every year. Vietnam signed an agreement in October to supply Japan with rare earths from its northwestern Lai Chu Province. In the US NioCorp Development Ltd has raised . billion in funding toward opening a niobium scandium and titanium mine at its Elk Creek site in southeast Nebraska which may be able to produce as much as tonnes of ferro niobium and tonnes of scandium dioxide annually. Also under consideration for mining are sites such as Thor Lake in the Northwest Territories and various locations in Vietnam. Additionally in a large deposit of rare earth minerals was discovered in Kvanefjeld in southern Greenland. Pre feasibility drilling at this site has confirmed significant quantities of black lujavrite which contains about rare earth oxides REO . The European Union has urged Greenland to restrict Chinese development of rare earth projects there but as of early the government of Greenland has said that it has no plans to impose such restrictions. Many Danish politicians have expressed concerns that other nations including China could gain influence in thinly populated Greenland given the number of foreign workers and investment that could come from Chinese companies in the near future because of the law passed December . In central Spain Ciudad Real Province the proposed rare earth mining project Matamulas may provide according to its developers up to Tn year of the annual UE demand . However this project has been suspended by regional authorities due to social and environmental concerns . Adding to potential mine sites ASX listed Peak Resources announced in February that their Tanzanian based Ngualla project contained not only the th largest deposit by tonnage outside of China but also the highest grade of rare earth elements of the . North Korea has been reported to have exported rare earth ore to China about US . million worth during May and June . Rare earth elements may be a factor behind the thaw in North Korea United States relations. In early Australian mining company Lynas was reported to be hurrying to finish a US million rare earth refinery on the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia s industrial port of Kuantan. The plant would refine ore lanthanides concentrate from the Mount Weld mine in Australia. The ore would be trucked to Fremantle and transported by container ship to Kuantan. Within two years Lynas was said to expect the refinery to be able to meet nearly a third of the world s demand for rare earth materials not counting China. The Kuantan development brought renewed attention to the Malaysian town of Bukit Merah in Perak where a rare earth mine operated by a Mitsubishi Chemical subsidiary Asian Rare Earth closed in and left continuing environmental and health concerns. In mid after protests Malaysian government restrictions on the Lynas plant were announced. At that time citing subscription only Dow Jones Newswire reports a Barrons report said the Lynas investment was million and the projected share of the global market it would fill put at about a sixth. An independent review initiated by the Malaysian Government and conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA in to address concerns of radioactive hazards found no non compliance with international radiation safety standards. However the Malaysian authorities confirmed that as of October Lynas was not given any permit to import any rare earth ore into Malaysia. On February the Malaysian AELB Atomic Energy Licensing Board recommended that Lynas be issued a Temporary Operating License TOL subject to completion of a number of conditions. On April Lynas announced to the Malaysian media that these conditions had been met and was now waiting on the issuance of the licence. citation needed On September Lynas was issued a year Full Operating Stage License FOSL by the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board AELB . Significant quantities of rare earth oxides are found in tailings accumulated from years of uranium ore shale and loparite mining at Sillame Estonia. Due to the rising prices of rare earths extraction of these oxides has become economically viable. The country currently exports around tonnes per year representing around of world production. Similar resources are suspected in the western United States where gold rush era mines are believed to have discarded large amounts of rare earths because they had no value at the time. In May researchers from two universities in Japan announced that they had discovered rare earths in Ehime Prefecture Japan. In January a Japanese deep sea research vessel obtained seven deep sea mud core samples from the Pacific Ocean seafloor at to meters depth approximately kilometres mi south of the island of Minami Tori Shima. The research team found a mud layer to meters beneath the seabed with concentrations of up to . rare earth oxides. A potential deposit might compare in grade with the ion absorption type deposits in southern China that provide the bulk of Chinese REO mine production which grade in the range of . to . REO. Another recently developed source of rare earths is electronic waste and other wastes that have significant rare earth components. New advances in recycling technology have made extraction of rare earths from these materials more feasible and recycling plants are currently operating in Japan where there is an estimated tons of rare earths stored in unused electronics. In France the Rhodia group is setting up two factories in La Rochelle and Saint Fons that will produce tons of rare earths a year from used fluorescent lamps magnets and batteries. Coal and coal by products are a potential source of critical elements including rare earth elements REE with estimated amounts in the range of million metric tons. Global REE consumption US consumption of REE The uses applications and demand for rare earth elements has expanded over the years. Globally most REEs are used for catalysts and magnets. In USA more than half of REEs are used for catalysts and ceramics glass and polishing are also main uses. Other important uses of rare earth elements are applicable to the production of high performance magnets alloys glasses and electronics. Ce and La are important as catalysts and are used for petroleum refining and as diesel additives. Nd is important in magnet production in traditional and low carbon technologies. Rare earth elements in this category are used in the electric motors of hybrid and electric vehicles generators in wind turbines hard disc drives portable electronics microphones speakers. Ce La and Nd are important in alloy making and in the production of fuel cells and Nickel metal hydride batteries. Ce Ga and Nd are important in electronics and are used in the production of LCD and plasma screens fiber optics lasers as well as in medical imaging. Additional uses for earth elements are as tracers in medical applications fertilizers and in water treatment. REEs have been used in agriculture to increase plant growth productivity and stress resistance seemingly without negative effects for human and animal consumption. REEs are used in agriculture through REE enriched fertilizers which is a widely used practice in China. In addition REEs are feed additives for livestock which has resulted in increased production such as larger animals and a higher production of eggs and dairy products. However this practice has resulted in REE bio accumulation within livestock and has impacted vegetation and algae growth in these agricultural areas. Additionally while no ill effects have been observed at current low concentrations the effects over the long term and with accumulation over time are unknown prompting some calls for more research into their possible effects. REEs are naturally found in very low concentration in the environment. Near mining and industrial sites the concentrations can rise to many times the normal background levels. Once in the environment REEs can leach into the soil where their transport is determined by numerous factors such as erosion weathering pH precipitation ground water etc. Acting much like metals they can speciate depending on the soil condition being either motile or adsorbed to soil particles depending on conditions. Depending on their bio availability REEs can be absorbed into plants and later consumed by humans and animals. Including the mining of REEs and REE enriched fertilizers the production of phosphorus fertilizers also contribute to REE contamination due to their production and deposition around the phosphorus fertilizer production plants. Furthermore strong acids are used during the extraction process of REEs which can then leach out in to the environment and be transported through water bodies and result in the acidification of aquatic environments. Another additive of REE mining that contributes to REE environmental contamination is cerium oxide CeO which is produced during the combustion of diesel and is released as an exhaust particulate matter and contributes heavily to soil and water contamination. Mining refining and recycling of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. A potential hazard could be low level radioactive tailings resulting from the occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare earth element ores. Improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May China announced a major five month crackdown on illegal mining in order to protect the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South where mines commonly small rural and illegal operations are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply. However even the major operation in Baotou in Inner Mongolia where much of the world s rare earth supply is refined has caused major environmental damage. The Bukit Merah mine in Malaysia has been the focus of a US million cleanup that is proceeding in . After having accomplished the hilltop entombment of truckloads of radioactively contaminated material the project is expected to entail in summer the removal of more than steel barrels of radioactive waste to the hilltop repository. In May after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster widespread protests took place in Kuantan over the Lynas refinery and radioactive waste from it. The ore to be processed has very low levels of thorium and Lynas founder and chief executive Nicholas Curtis said There is absolutely no risk to public health. T. Jayabalan a doctor who says he has been monitoring and treating patients affected by the Mitsubishi plant is wary of Lynas s assurances. The argument that low levels of thorium in the ore make it safer doesn t make sense he says because radiation exposure is cumulative. Construction of the facility has been halted until an independent United Nations IAEA panel investigation is completed which is expected by the end of June . New restrictions were announced by the Malaysian government in late June. IAEA panel investigation is completed and no construction has been halted. Lynas is on budget and on schedule to start producing . The IAEA report has concluded in a report issued on Thursday June said it did not find any instance of any non compliance with international radiation safety standards in the project. If the proper safety standards are followed REE mining is relatively low impact. Molycorp before going bankrupt often exceeded environmental regulations to improve public image. Literature published in suggests that along with previously established pollution mitigation a more circular supply chain would help mitigate some of the pollution that the extraction point. This means recycling and reusing REEs that are already in use or reaching the end of their life cycle. The mining of REEs have caused the contamination of surrounding soil and water of these production areas which has impacted vegetation in these area by decreasing chlorophyll production which affects photosynthesis and inhibits the growth of the plants. However the impact of REE contamination on vegetation is dependent on the plants present in the contaminated environments because there are some plants that do retain and absorb REEs and there are some that don t. Also the ability for the vegetation to intake the REE is dependent on the type of REE present in the soil hence there are a multitude of factors that influence this process. Agricultural plants are the main type of vegetation affected by REE contamination in the environment. Also the main two plants that have a higher chance of absorbing and storing REEs are apples and beets. Furthermore there is a possibility that the REE that can leach out into aquatic environments and can be absorbed by aquatic vegetation which can then bio accumulate and potentially enter the human food chain if livestock or humans choose to eat the vegetation. An example of this situation was the case of the water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes in China where the water was contaminated due to a REE enriched fertilizer being used in an agricultural area of close proximity. This led to the nearby aquatic environment becoming contaminated with Cerium and resulted in the water hyacinth becoming three times more concentrated in Cerium than its surrounding water. REEs are a large group with many different properties and levels in the environment because of this and limited research it has been difficult to determine safe levels of exposure for humans. A number of studies have focused on risk assessment based on routes of exposure and divergence from back ground levels related to nearby agriculture mining and industry. It has been demonstrated that numerous REEs have toxic properties and are present in the environment or in work places. Exposure to these can lead to a wide range of negative health outcomes such as cancer respiratory issues dental loss including death. However these elements are numerous and present in many different forms and at different levels of toxicity as such it has been difficult to give blanket warnings on cancer risk and toxicity as some of these are harmless while others pose a risk. What toxicity is shown appears to be at very high levels of exposure through ingestion of contaminated food and water through inhalation of dust smoke particles either as an occupational hazard or due to proximity to contaminated sites such as mines and cities. Therefore the main issues that these residents would face is bioaccumulation of REEs and the impact on their respiratory system but overall there can be other possible short term and long term health effects. It was found that people living near mines in China had many times the levels of REEs in their blood urine bone and hair compared to controls far from mining sites. This higher level was related to the high levels of REEs present in the vegetables they cultivated the soil and the water from the wells indicating that the high levels were caused by the nearby mine. While REE levels varied between men and women the group most at risk were children because REEs can impacted the neurological development of children. Hence it can impact their IQ and can cause memory loss. Residents blamed a rare earth refinery at Bukit Merah for birth defects and eight leukemia cases within five years in a community of after many years with no leukemia cases. Seven of the leukemia victims died. Osamu Shimizu a director of Asian Rare Earth said the company might have sold a few bags of calcium phosphate fertilizer on a trial basis as it sought to market byproducts calcium phosphate is not radioactive or dangerous in reply to a former resident of Bukit Merah who said that The cows that ate the grass grown with the fertilizer all died. Malaysia s Supreme Court ruled on December that there was no evidence that the local chemical joint venture Asian Rare Earth was contaminating the local environment. Experiments exposing rats to various cerium compounds have found accumulation primarily in the lungs and liver. This resulted in various negative health outcomes associated with those organs. REEs have been added to feed in livestock to increase their body mass and increase milk production. They are most commonly used to increase the body mass of pigs and it was discovered that REEs increase the digestibility and nutrient use of pigs digestive system. Studies point to a dose response when considering toxicity versus positive effects. While small doses in the environment and properly administered seem to have no ill effects. Larger doses have been shown to have negative effects specifically in the organs where they accumulate. The process mining of REEs in China has resulted in soil and water contamination in certain areas which has then transported through these systems and in these aquatic bodies it could potentially bio accumulate within aquatic biota. Furthermore in some cases animals that live in the REE contaminated areas have been diagnosed with organ or system problems. Furthermore REEs have been used in freshwater fish farming by allowing the fish to consume the REE because it protects the fish from possible diseases. One main reason why they have been avidly used in animal livestock feeding is that they have had better results than inorganic livestock feed enhancers. China has officially cited resource depletion and environmental concerns as the reasons for a nationwide crackdown on its rare earth mineral production sector. However non environmental motives have also been imputed to China s rare earth policy. According to The Economist Slashing their exports of rare earth metals is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials. Furthermore China currently has an effective monopoly on the world s REE Value Chain. all the refineries and processing plants that transform the raw ore into valuable elements . In the words of Deng Xiaoping a Chinese politician from the late s to the late s The Middle East has oil we have rare earths ... it is of extremely important strategic significance we must be sure to handle the rare earth issue properly and make the fullest use of our country s advantage in rare earth resources. One possible example of market control is the division of General Motors that deals with miniaturized magnet research which shut down its US office and moved its entire staff to China in China s export quota only applies to the metal but not products made from these metals such as magnets . It was reported but officially denied by whom that China instituted an export ban on shipments of rare earth oxides but not alloys to Japan on September in response to the detainment of a Chinese fishing boat captain by the Japanese Coast Guard. On September a few days before the fishing boat incident The Economist reported that China...in July announced the latest in a series of annual export reductions this time by to precisely tonnes. The United States Department of Energy in its Critical Materials Strategy report identified dysprosium as the element that was most critical in terms of import reliance. A report China s Rare Earth Industry issued by the US Geological Survey and US Department of the Interior outlines industry trends within China and examines national policies that may guide the future of the country s production. The report notes that China s lead in the production of rare earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In China accounted for only of such minerals. In world production was metric tons China produced of those tons. According to the report recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world Owing to the increase in domestic demand the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years. In China allowed domestic rare earth producers and traders and Sino foreign rare earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually by only domestic rare earth producers and traders and Sino foreign rare earth producers were authorized. The government s future policies will likely keep in place strict controls According to China s draft rare earth development plan annual rare earth production may be limited to between and metric tons during the period from to . The export quota for rare earth products may be about metric tons and the Government may allow domestic rare earth producers and traders to export rare earths. The United States Geological Survey is actively surveying southern Afghanistan for rare earth deposits under the protection of United States military forces. Since the USGS has conducted remote sensing surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare earth metals exist in Helmand province near the village of Khanneshin. The USGS study team has located a sizable area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano containing light rare earth elements including cerium and neodymium. It has mapped . million metric tons of desirable rock or about years of supply at current demand levels. The Pentagon has estimated its value at about . billion. It has been argued that the geopolitical importance of rare earths has been exaggerated in the literature on the geopolitics of renewable energy underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production. This especially concerns neodymium. Due to its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines it has been argued that neodymium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy. But this perspective has been criticised for and failing to recognise that most wind turbines have gears and do not use permanent magnets.",FALSE

Renewable resources are a part of Earth s natural environment and the largest components of its ecosphere. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource s sustainability. Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production as in sustainable agriculture and to an extent water resources. In Paul Alfred Weiss defined renewable resources as The total range of living organisms providing man with life fibres etc... . Another type of renewable resources is renewable energy resources. Common sources of renewable energy include solar geothermal and wind power which are all categorised as renewable resources. Water can be considered a renewable material when carefully controlled usage treatment and release are followed. If not it would become a non renewable resource at that location. For example as groundwater is usually removed from an aquifer at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge it is a considered non renewable resource. Removal of water from the pore spaces in aquifers may cause permanent compaction subsidence that cannot be renewed. . of the water on the Earth is salt water and is fresh water slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater with only a small fraction . present above ground or in the air. Water pollution is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that of worldwide water is used in industry. Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams thermoelectric power plants which use water for cooling ore and oil refineries which use water in chemical processes and manufacturing plants which use water as a solvent . Desalination of seawater is considered a renewable source of water although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable. Panorama of a natural wetland Sinclair Wetlands New Zealand Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals. Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores. The phrase sustainable agriculture was coined by Australian agricultural scientist Gordon McClymont. It has been defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site specific application that will last over the long term . Expansion of agricultural land reduces biodiversity and contributes to deforestation. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development along with reclamation of wetlands and conversion of forest to cultivation resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion. Although air and sunlight are available everywhere on Earth crops also depend on soil nutrients and the availability of water. Monoculture is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced yields. Monoculture can also cause the build up of pathogens and pests that target one specific species. The Great Irish Famine is a well known example of the dangers of monoculture. Crop rotation and long term crop rotations confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops and can improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep rooted and shallow rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands returning lost nutrients indefinitely such as the Flooding of the Nile the long term use of biochar and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests drought or lack of nutrients. Agricultural practices are one of the single greatest contributor to the global increase in soil erosion rates. It is estimated that more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa s soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates. The Dust Bowl phenomenon in the s was caused by severe drought combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation fallow fields cover crops soil terracing and wind breaking trees to prevent wind erosion. The tillage of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by water erosion. The phenomenon called peak soil describes how large scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity s ability to grow food in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices the availability of arable soil may become increasingly problematic. Methods to combat erosion include no till farming using a keyline design growing wind breaks to hold the soil and widespread use of compost. Fertilizers and pesticides can also have an effect of soil erosion citation needed which can contribute to soil salinity and prevent other species from growing. Phosphate is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in years and that Peak Phosphate will occur in about . Industrial processing and logistics also have an effect on agriculture s sustainability. The way and locations crops are sold requires energy for transportation as well as the energy cost for materials labour and transport. Food sold at a local location such a farmers market have reduced energy overheads. Air is a renewable resource. All living organisms need oxygen nitrogen directly or indirectly carbon directly or indirectly and many other gases in small quantities for their survival. An important renewable resource is wood provided by means of forestry which has been used for construction housing and firewood since ancient times. Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources the main distinction is between energy crops and non food crops. A large variety of lubricants industrially used vegetable oils textiles and fibre made e.g. of cotton copra or hemp paper derived from wood rags or grasses bioplastic are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like latex ethanol resin sugar and starch can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include fur leather technical fat and lubricants and further derived products as e.g. animal glue tendons casings or in historical times ambra and baleen provided by whaling. With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs plants are important sources however e.g. venom of snakes frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in insulin and important hormones were based on animal sources. Feathers an important byproduct of poultry farming for food is still being used as filler and as base for keratin in general. Same applies for the chitin produced in farming Crustaceans which may be used as base of chitosan. The most important part of the human body used for non medical purposes is human hair as for artificial hair integrations which is being traded worldwide. Historically renewable resources like firewood latex guano charcoal wood ash plant colors as indigo and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era. Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in deforestation overgrazing or overfishing. In addition to fresh meat and milk which as food items are not the topic of this section livestock farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as tendons horn bones bladders. Complex technical constructions as the composite bow were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as Food vs. fuel. Conflicts between food needs and usage as supposed by fief obligations were in so far common in historical times as well. However a significant percentage of middle European farmers yields went into livestock which provides as well organic fertiliser. Oxen and horses were important for transportation purposes drove engines as e.g. in treadmills. Other regions solved the transportation problem with terracing urban and garden agriculture. Further conflicts as between forestry and herding or sheep herders and cattle farmers led to various solutions. Some confined wool production and sheep to large state and nobility domains or outsourced to professional shepherds with larger wandering herds. The British Agricultural Revolution was mainly based on a new system of crop rotation the four field rotation. British agriculturist Charles Townshend recognised the invention in Dutch Waasland and popularised it in the th century UK George Washington Carver in the USA. The system used wheat turnips and barley and introduced as well clover. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air a practically non exhaustive renewable resource into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus livestock could to be bred year round and winter culling was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from wood pasture. Early modern times and the th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively. Besides the still central role of wood there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming global shortage of fossil fuels local shortages due to boycotts war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables. The use of certain basically renewable products as in TCM endangers various species. Just the black market in rhinoceros horn reduced the world s rhino population by more than percent over the past years. The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of IG Farben dominated the world market for synthetic dyes at the beginning of the th century and had an important role in artificial pharmaceuticals photographic film agricultural chemicals and electrochemicals. However the former Plant breeding research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the German colonial empire important players in the field as Erwin Baur and Konrad Meyer switched to using local crops as base for economic autarky. Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort. A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time. There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow frost resistant olive species but some success in the case of hemp flax rapeseed which are still of current importance. During World War German scientists tried to use Russian Taraxacum dandelion species to manufacture natural rubber. Rubber dandelions are still of interest as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME announced to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables. The UK uses Non Fossil Fuel Obligations NFFO a collection of orders requiring the electricity Distribution Network Operators in England and Wales to purchase electricity from the nuclear power and renewable energy sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in Scotland the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation and Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Non Fossil Fuel Obligation . In the USA Renewable Energy Certificates RECs use a similar approach. German Energiewende is using fed in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants compare Tilbury power stations and cement works making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe s renewable energy consumption. Biorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry. Biorenewable chemicals can provide solar energy powered substitutes for the petroleum based carbon feedstocks that currently supply the chemical industry. The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms and the potential for synthetic biology to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities can drive the chemical industry. A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the polyketide biosynthetic pathway which generates chemicals containing repeated alkyl chain units with potential for a wide variety of functional groups at the different carbon atoms. Bioplastics are a form of plastics derived from renewable biomass sources such as vegetable fats and oils lignin corn starch pea starch or microbiota. The most common form of bioplastic is thermoplastic starch. Other forms include Cellulose bioplastics biopolyester Polylactic acid and bio derived polyethylene. The production and use of bioplastics is generally regarded as a more sustainable activity when compared to plastic production from petroleum petroplastic however manufacturing of bioplastic materials is often still reliant upon petroleum as an energy and materials source. Because of the fragmentation in the market and ambiguous definitions it is difficult to describe the total market size for bioplastics but the global production capacity is estimated at tonnes. In contrast global consumption of all flexible packaging is estimated at around . million tonnes. Bioasphalt is an asphalt alternative made from non petroleum based renewable resources. Manufacturing sources of bioasphalt include sugar molasses and rice corn and potato starches and vegetable oil based waste. Asphalt made with vegetable oil based binders was patented by Colas SA in France in . Renewable energy refers to the provision of energy via renewable resources which are naturally replenished fast enough as being used. It includes e.g. sunlight wind biomass rain tides waves and geothermal heat. Renewable energy may replace or enhance fossil energy supply various distinct areas electricity generation hot water space heating motor fuels and rural off grid energy services. Biomass is referring to biological material from living or recently living organisms most often referring to plants or plant derived materials. Sustainable harvesting and use of renewable resources i.e. maintaining a positive renewal rate can reduce air pollution soil contamination habitat destruction and land degradation. Biomass energy is derived from six distinct energy sources garbage wood plants waste landfill gases and alcohol fuels. Historically humans have harnessed biomass derived energy since the advent of burning wood to make fire and wood remains the largest biomass energy source today. However low tech use of biomass which still amounts for more than of world energy needs may induce indoor air pollution in developing nations and results in between . million and million deaths in . The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by products such as wood residues are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius sugar cane residue and Southeast Asia rice husks . Animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the UK. The biomass power generating industry in the United States which consists of approximately MW of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid produces about . percent of the U.S. electricity supply. A biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological carbon fixation. Biofuels include fuels derived from biomass conversion as well as solid biomass liquid fuels and various biogases. Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or switchgrass. Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biogas is methane produced by the process of anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes. etc. is also a renewable source of energy. Biogas typically refers to a mixture of gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic bacteria or fermentation of biodegradable materials such as manure sewage municipal waste green waste plant material and crops. It is primarily methane CH and carbon dioxide CO and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulphide HS moisture and siloxanes. Natural fibres are a class of hair like materials that are continuous filaments or are in discrete elongated pieces similar to pieces of thread. They can be used as a component of composite materials. They can also be matted into sheets to make products such as paper or felt. Fibres are of two types natural fibre which consists of animal and plant fibres and man made fibre which consists of synthetic fibres and regenerated fibres. Renewable resources are endangered by non regulated industrial developments and growth. They must be carefully managed to avoid exceeding the natural world s capacity to replenish them. A life cycle assessment provides a systematic means of evaluating renewability. This is a matter of sustainability in the natural environment. National Geographic has described ocean over fishing as simply the taking of wildlife from the sea at rates too high for fished species to replace themselves. Tuna meat is driving overfishing as to endanger some species like the bluefin tuna. The European Community and other organisations are trying to regulate fishery as to protect species and to prevent their extinctions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea treaty deals with aspects of overfishing in articles and . Examples of overfishing exist in areas such as the North Sea of Europe the Grand Banks of North America and the East China Sea of Asia. The decline of penguin population is caused in part by overfishing caused by human competition over the same renewable resources Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen. The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of climate change. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes global warming which is better known as the greenhouse effect. Deforestation also affects the water cycle. It reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. Deforestation reduces soil cohesion so that erosion flooding and landslides ensue. Rain forests house many species and organisms providing people with food and other commodities. In this way biofuels may well be unsustainable if their production contributes to deforestation. Some renewable resources species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over consumption. It has been estimated that over of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct. Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Internationally countries have signed an accord agreeing to create Biodiversity Action Plans to protect endangered and other threatened species.",FALSE

WtE is a form of energy recovery. Most WtE processes generate electricity and or heat directly through combustion or produce a combustible fuel commodity such as methane methanol ethanol or synthetic fuels. The first incinerator or Destructor was built in Nottingham UK in by Manlove Alliott Co. Ltd. to the design of Alfred Fryer. The first US incinerator was built in on Governors Island in New York New York. The first waste incinerator in Denmark was built in in Frederiksberg The first facility in the Czech Republic was built in in Brno. Gasification and pyrolysis processes have been known and used for centuries and for coal as early as the th century.... Development technologies for processing residual solid mixed waste has only become a focus of attention in recent years stimulated by the search for more efficient energy recovery. Incineration the combustion of organic material such as waste with energy recovery is the most common WtE implementation. All new WtE plants in OECD countries incinerating waste residual MSW commercial industrial or RDF must meet strict emission standards including those on nitrogen oxides NOx sulphur dioxide SO heavy metals and dioxins. Hence modern incineration plants are vastly different from old types some of which neither recovered energy nor materials. Modern incinerators reduce the volume of the original waste by percent depending upon composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling. Incinerators may emit fine particulate heavy metals trace dioxin and acid gas even though these emissions are relatively low from modern incinerators. Other concerns include proper management of residues toxic fly ash which must be handled in hazardous waste disposal installation as well as incinerator bottom ash IBA which must be reused properly. Critics argue that incinerators destroy valuable resources and they may reduce incentives for recycling. The question however is an open one as European countries which recycle the most up to also incinerate to avoid landfilling. Incinerators have electric efficiencies of . In order to avoid losing the rest of the energy it can be used for e.g. district heating cogeneration . The total efficiencies of cogeneration incinerators are typically higher than based on the lower heating value of the waste . The method of incineration to convert municipal solid waste MSW is a relatively old method of WtE generation. Incineration generally entails burning waste residual MSW commercial industrial and RDF to boil water which powers steam generators that generate electric energy and heat to be used in homes businesses institutions and industries. One problem associated is the potential for pollutants to enter the atmosphere with the flue gases from the boiler. These pollutants can be acidic and in the s were reported to cause environmental degradation by turning rain into acid rain. Modern incinerators incorporate carefully engineered primary and secondary burn chambers and controlled burners designed to burn completely with the lowest possible emissions. In some cases eliminating the need for lime scrubbers and electro static precipitators on smokestacks. By passing the smoke through the basic lime scrubbers any acids that might be in the smoke are neutralized which prevents the acid from reaching the atmosphere and hurting the environment. Many other devices such as fabric filters reactors and catalysts destroy or capture other regulated pollutants. According to the New York Times modern incineration plants are so clean that many times more dioxin is now released from home fireplaces and backyard barbecues than from incineration. According to the German Environmental Ministry because of stringent regulations waste incineration plants are no longer significant in terms of emissions of dioxins dust and heavy metals . There are a number of other new and emerging technologies that are able to produce energy from waste and other fuels without direct combustion. Many of these technologies have the potential to produce more electric power from the same amount of fuel than would be possible by direct combustion. This is mainly due to the separation of corrosive components ash from the converted fuel thereby allowing higher combustion temperatures in e.g. boilers gas turbines internal combustion engines fuel cells. Some are able to efficiently convert the energy into liquid or gaseous fuels Thermal technologies Non thermal technologies During the period the waste to energy capacity increased by about four million metric tons per year. Japan and China each built several plants based on direct smelting or on fluidized bed combustion of solid waste. In China there are about waste to energy plants in early . Japan is the largest user in thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in the world with million tons. Some of the newest plants use stoker technology and others use the advanced oxygen enrichment technology. Several treatment plants exist worldwide using relatively novel processes such as direct smelting the Ebara fluidization process and the Thermoselect JFE gasification and melting technology process. In India its first energy bio science center was developed to reduce the country s green house gases and its dependency on fossil fuel. As of June Indonesia had a total of . MW installed capacity of waste to energy with a pipeline of projects in different preparation phases together amounting to another MW of capacity. Biofuel Energy Corporation of Denver CO opened two new biofuel plants in Wood River Nebraska and Fairmont Minnesota in July . These plants use distillation to make ethanol for use in motor vehicles and other engines. Both plants are currently reported to be working at over capacity. Fulcrum BioEnergy incorporated located in Pleasanton California is building a WtE plant near Reno NV. The plant is scheduled to open in under the name of Sierra BioFuels plant. BioEnergy incorporated predicts that the plant will produce approximately . million gallons per year of ethanol from nearly tons per year of MSW. Waste to energy technology includes fermentation which can take biomass and create ethanol using waste cellulosic or organic material. In the fermentation process the sugar in the waste is changed to carbon dioxide and alcohol in the same general process that is used to make wine. Normally fermentation occurs with no air present. Esterification can also be done using waste to energy technologies and the result of this process is biodiesel. The cost effectiveness of esterification will depend on the feedstock being used and all the other relevant factors such as transportation distance amount of oil present in the feedstock and others. Gasification and pyrolysis by now can reach gross thermal conversion efficiencies fuel to gas up to however a complete combustion is superior in terms of fuel conversion efficiency. Some pyrolysis processes need an outside heat source which may be supplied by the gasification process making the combined process self sustaining. In thermal WtE technologies nearly all of the carbon content in the waste is emitted as carbon dioxide CO to the atmosphere when including final combustion of the products from pyrolysis and gasification except when producing bio char for fertilizer . Municipal solid waste MSW contain approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as CO itself so treatment of metric ton . short tons of MSW produce approximately metric ton . short tons of CO. In the event that the waste was landfilled metric ton . short tons of MSW would produce approximately cubic metres cu ft methane via the anaerobic decomposition of the biodegradable part of the waste. This amount of methane has more than twice the global warming potential than the metric ton . short tons of CO which would have been produced by combustion. In some countries large amounts of landfill gas are collected but still the global warming potential of the landfill gas emitted to atmosphere in e.g. the US in was approximately higher than the amount of CO that would have been emitted by combustion. In addition nearly all biodegradable waste is biomass. That is it has biological origin. This material has been formed by plants using atmospheric CO typically within the last growing season. If these plants are regrown the CO emitted from their combustion will be taken out from the atmosphere once more. Such considerations are the main reason why several countries administrate WtE of the biomass part of waste as renewable energy. The rest mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products is generally treated as non renewables. MSW to a large extent is of biological origin biogenic e.g. paper cardboard wood cloth food scraps. Typically half of the energy content in MSW is from biogenic material. Consequently this energy is often recognised as renewable energy according to the waste input. Several methods have been developed by the European CEN working group to determine the biomass fraction of waste fuels such as Refuse Derived Fuel Solid Recovered Fuel. The initial two methods developed CEN TS were the manual sorting method and the selective dissolution method. A detailed systematic comparison of these two methods was published in . Since each method suffered from limitations in properly characterizing the biomass fraction two alternative methods have been developed. The first method uses the principles of radiocarbon dating. A technical review CEN TR outlining the carbon method was published in . A technical standard of the carbon dating method CEN TS will be published in . needs update In the United States there is already an equivalent carbon method under the standard method ASTM D. The second method so called balance method employs existing data on materials composition and operating conditions of the WtE plant and calculates the most probable result based on a mathematical statistical model. Currently the balance method is installed at three Austrian and eight Danish incinerators. A comparison between both methods carried out at three full scale incinerators in Switzerland showed that both methods came to the same results. Carbon dating can determine with precision the biomass fraction of waste and also determine the biomass calorific value. Determining the calorific value is important for green certificate programs such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate program in the United Kingdom. These programs award certificates based on the energy produced from biomass. Several research papers including the one commissioned by the Renewable Energy Association in the UK have been published that demonstrate how the carbon result can be used to calculate the biomass calorific value. The UK gas and electricity markets authority Ofgem released a statement in accepting the use of Carbon as a way to determine the biomass energy content of waste feedstock under their administration of the Renewables Obligation. Their Fuel Measurement and Sampling FMS questionnaire describes the information they look for when considering such proposals. According to the International Solid Waste Association ISWA there are WtE plants in Europe and in the United States . The following are some examples of WtE plants.

Some examples of agricultural resources that make up many biobased products include soybeans corn kenaf flax jute and numerous other types of crops that are harvested. Current applications of these agricultural resources create products such as ethanol corn based soy candles soy based lubricants kenaf office paper and bioplastics to name a few. The purchasing of biobased products helps many of the farmers across America who grow corn soybeans and other resources used by companies in the biobased industry. For example ethanol is currently one of the leading alternative fuel sources in the U.S. In year the Renewable Fuels Association reported million US gallons m produced by plants. Currently for the year there are ethanol plants with more in production. A majority of these plants are owned by a collective of farms across the midwest. Another key benefit of biobased products is that they are not petroleum based. This helps alleviate the consumption of resources that harm the environment in terms of biodegrability toxicity and pollution. The following organizations are leading the way in supporting the Biobased Industry. The program was created after the passing of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of FSRIA when it was then known as the Federal Biobased Products Preferred Procurement Program or FBP. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is overseeing the program. The research undertaken by the program helps implement the Farm Bill s requirement of getting federal agencies to specifically buy biobased products. One key factor is the requirement that such products are readily available reasonably priced and pass the required performance standards of their non biobased counterparts. The United Soybean Board helps promote the use of soybeans farmed across America for use in consumer and industrial products. Originally created from the Farm Bill and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture the United Soybean Board performs research advertising and other functions to strengthen the soybean industry.

In domestic waste collection the scope of biodegradable waste may be narrowed to include only those degradable wastes capable of being handled in the local waste handling facilities. Biodegradable waste can be found in municipal solid waste sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste or BMW as green waste food waste paper waste and biodegradable plastics. Other biodegradable wastes include human waste manure sewage sewage sludge and slaughterhouse waste. In the absence of oxygen much of this waste will decay to methane by anaerobic digestion. In many parts of the developed world biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream either by separate curb side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as green waste. Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be composted. Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat electricity and fuel by means of incineration or anaerobic digestion. Swiss Kompogas and the Danish AIKAN process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste.

"84",84,"deconstruction","/wiki/Deconstruction",TRUE,0,"approach|philosoph|","Originated by the philosopher Jacques Derrida deconstruction is an approach to understanding the relationship between text and meaning","Originated by the philosopher Jacques Derrida deconstruction is an approach to understanding the relationship between text and meaning. Derrida s approach consisted of conducting readings of texts looking for things that run counter to the intended meaning or structural unity of a particular text. The purpose of deconstruction is to show that the usage of language in a given text and language as a whole are irreducibly complex unstable or impossible. Throughout his readings Derrida hoped to show deconstruction at work. Many debates in continental philosophy surrounding ontology epistemology ethics aesthetics hermeneutics and philosophy of language refer to Derrida s observations. Since the s these observations inspired a range of theoretical enterprises in the humanities including the disciplines of law anthropology historiography linguistics sociolinguistics psychoanalysis LGBT studies and the feminist school of thought. Deconstruction also inspired deconstructivism in architecture and remains important within art music and literary criticism. Jacques Derrida s book Of Grammatology introduced the majority of ideas influential within deconstruction. Derrida published a number of other works directly relevant to the concept of deconstruction. Books showing deconstruction in action or defining it more completely include Diffrance Speech and Phenomena and Writing and Difference. According to Derrida and taking inspiration from the work of Ferdinand de Saussure language as a system of signs and words only has meaning because of the contrast between these signs. As Rorty contends words have meaning only because of contrast effects with other words...no word can acquire meaning in the way in which philosophers from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell have hoped it might by being the unmediated expression of something non linguistic e.g. an emotion a sense datum a physical object an idea a Platonic Form . As a consequence meaning is never present but rather is deferred to other signs. Derrida refers to the in this view mistaken belief that there is a self sufficient non deferred meaning as metaphysics of presence. A concept then must be understood in the context of its opposite such as being nothingness normal abnormal speech writing etc. Further Derrida contends that in a classical philosophical opposition we are not dealing with the peaceful coexistence of a vis a vis but rather with a violent hierarchy. One of the two terms governs the other axiologically logically etc. or has the upper hand signified over signifier intelligible over sensible speech over writing activity over passivity etc. The first task of deconstruction would be to find and overturn these oppositions inside a text or a corpus of texts but the final objective of deconstruction is not to surpass all oppositions because it is assumed they are structurally necessary to produce sense. The oppositions simply cannot be suspended once and for all. The hierarchy of dual oppositions always reestablishes itself. Deconstruction only points to the necessity of an unending analysis that can make explicit the decisions and arbitrary violence intrinsic to all texts. Finally Derrida argues that it is not enough to expose and deconstruct the way oppositions work and then stop there in a nihilistic or cynical position thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively . To be effective deconstruction needs to create new terms not to synthesize the concepts in opposition but to mark their difference and eternal interplay. This explains why Derrida always proposes new terms in his deconstruction not as a free play but as a pure necessity of analysis to better mark the intervals. Derrida called undecidables that is unities of simulacrum false verbal properties nominal or semantic that can no longer be included within philosophical binary opposition but which however inhabit philosophical oppositions resisting and organizing it without ever constituting a third term without ever leaving room for a solution in the form of Hegelian dialectics e.g. diffrance archi writing pharmakon supplement hymen gram spacing . Derrida s theories on deconstruction were themselves influenced by the work of linguists such as Ferdinand de Saussure whose writings on semiotics also became a cornerstone of structuralist theory in the mid th century and literary theorists such as Roland Barthes whose works were an investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought . Derrida s views on deconstruction stood in opposition to the theories of structuralists such as psychoanalytic theorist Jacques Lacan and anthropologist Claude Lvi Strauss. However Derrida resisted attempts to label his work as post structuralist . citation needed In order to understand Derrida s motivation one must refer to Nietzsche s philosophy. Nietzsche s project began with Orpheus the man underground. This foil to Platonic light was deliberately and self consciously lauded in Daybreak when Nietzsche announces albeit retrospectively In this work you will discover a subterranean man at work and then goes on to map the project of unreason All things that live long are gradually so saturated with reason that their origin in unreason thereby becomes improbable. Does not almost every precise history of an origination impress our feelings as paradoxical and wantonly offensive Does the good historian not at bottom constantly contradict . Nietzsche s point in Daybreak is that standing at the end of modern history modern thinkers know too much to be deceived by the illusion of reason any more. Reason logic philosophy and science are no longer solely sufficient as the royal roads to truth. And so Nietzsche decides to throw it in our faces and uncover the truth of Plato that he unlike Orpheus just happened to discover his true love in the light instead of in the dark. This being merely one historical event amongst many Nietzsche proposes that we revisualize the history of the West as the history of a series of political moves that is a manifestation of the will to power that at bottom have no greater or lesser claim to truth in any noumenal absolute sense. By calling our attention to the fact that he has assumed the role of Orpheus the man underground in dialectical opposition to Plato Nietzsche hopes to sensitize us to the political and cultural context and the political influences that impact authorship. For example the political influences that led one author to choose philosophy over poetry or at least portray himself as having made such a choice and another to make a different choice. The problem with Nietzsche as Derrida sees it is that he did not go far enough. That he missed the fact that this will to power is itself but a manifestation of the operation of writing. And so Derrida wishes to help us step beyond Nietzsche s penultimate revaluation of all western values to the ultimate which is the final appreciation of the role of writing in the production of knowledge . Derrida approaches all texts as constructed around elemental oppositions which all discourse has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This is so because identity is viewed in non essentialist terms as a construct and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of difference inside a system of distinct signs . This approach to text is influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure is considered one of the fathers of structuralism when he explained that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language In language there are only differences. Even more important a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. ... A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values. Saussure explicitly suggested that linguistics was only a branch of a more general semiology a science of signs in general human codes being only one part. Nevertheless in the end as Derrida pointed out Saussure made linguistics the regulatory model and for essential and essentially metaphysical reasons had to privilege speech and everything that links the sign to phone . Derrida will prefer to follow the more fruitful paths formalization of a general semiotics without falling into what he considered a hierarchizing teleology privileging linguistics and to speak of mark rather than of language not as something restricted to mankind but as prelinguistic as the pure possibility of language working everywhere there is a relation to something else. Derrida s original use of the word deconstruction was a translation of Destruktion a concept from the work of Martin Heidegger that Derrida sought to apply to textual reading. Heidegger s term referred to a process of exploring the categories and concepts that tradition has imposed on a word and the history behind them. Derrida s concerns flow from a consideration of several issues To this end Derrida follows a long line of modern philosophers who look backwards to Plato and his influence on the Western metaphysical tradition. page needed Like Nietzsche Derrida suspects Plato of dissimulation in the service of a political project namely the education through critical reflections of a class of citizens more strategically positioned to influence the polis. However like Nietzsche Derrida is not satisfied merely with such a political interpretation of Plato because of the particular dilemma modern humans find themselves in. His Platonic reflections are inseparably part of his critique of modernity hence the attempt to be something beyond the modern because of this Nietzschian sense that the modern has lost its way and become mired in nihilism. Diffrance is the observation that the meanings of words come from their synchrony with other words within the language and their diachrony between contemporary and historical definitions of a word. Understanding language according to Derrida requires an understanding of both viewpoints of linguistic analysis. The focus on diachrony has led to accusations against Derrida of engaging in the etymological fallacy. There is one statement by Derrida in an essay on Rousseau in Of Grammatology which has been of great interest to his opponents. It is the assertion that there is no outside text il n y a pas de hors texte which is often mistranslated as there is nothing outside of the text . The mistranslation is often used to suggest Derrida believes that nothing exists but words. Michel Foucault for instance famously misattributed to Derrida the very different phrase Il n y a rien en dehors du texte for this purpose. According to Derrida his statement simply refers to the unavoidability of context that is at the heart of diffrance. For example the word house derives its meaning more as a function of how it differs from shed mansion hotel building etc. Form of Content that Louis Hjelmslev distinguished from Form of Expression than how the word house may be tied to a certain image of a traditional house i.e. the relationship between signified and signifier with each term being established in reciprocal determination with the other terms than by an ostensive description or definition when can we talk about a house or a mansion or a shed The same can be said about verbs in all the languages in the world when should we stop saying walk and start saying run The same happens of course with adjectives when must we stop saying yellow and start saying orange or exchange past for present Not only are the topological differences between the words relevant here but the differentials between what is signified is also covered by diffrance. Thus complete meaning is always differential and postponed in language there is never a moment when meaning is complete and total. A simple example would consist of looking up a given word in a dictionary then proceeding to look up the words found in that word s definition etc. also comparing with older dictionaries. Such a process would never end. Derrida describes the task of deconstruction as the identification of metaphysics of presence or logocentrism in western philosophy. Metaphysics of presence is the desire for immediate access to meaning the privileging of presence over absence. This means that there is an assumed bias in certain binary oppositions where one side is placed in a position over another such as good over bad speech over the written word male over female. Derrida writes Without a doubt Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of ousia as parousia on the basis of the now the point etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle s text both this limitation and its opposite . To Derrida the central bias of logocentrism was the now being placed as more important than the future or past. This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger who in Being and Time claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as ready to hand and being with. citation needed In the deconstruction procedure one of the main concerns of Derrida is to not collapse into Hegel s dialectic where these oppositions would be reduced to contradictions in a dialectic that has the purpose of resolving it into a synthesis. The presence of Hegelian dialectics was enormous in the intellectual life of France during the second half of the th century with the influence of Kojve and Hyppolite but also with the impact of dialectics based on contradiction developed by Marxists and including the existentialism of Sartre etc. This explains Derrida s concern to always distinguish his procedure from Hegel s since Hegelianism believes binary oppositions would produce a synthesis while Derrida saw binary oppositions as incapable of collapsing into a synthesis free from the original contradiction. There have been problems defining deconstruction. Derrida claimed that all of his essays were attempts to define what deconstruction is and that deconstruction is necessarily complicated and difficult to explain since it actively criticises the very language needed to explain it. Derrida has been more forthcoming with negative apophatic than with positive descriptions of deconstruction. When asked by Toshihiko Izutsu some preliminary considerations on how to translate deconstruction in Japanese in order to at least prevent using a Japanese term contrary to deconstruction s actual meaning Derrida began his response by saying that such a question amounts to what deconstruction is not or rather ought not to be . Derrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis a critique or a method in the traditional sense that philosophy understands these terms. In these negative descriptions of deconstruction Derrida is seeking to multiply the cautionary indicators and put aside all the traditional philosophical concepts . This does not mean that deconstruction has absolutely nothing in common with an analysis a critique or a method because while Derrida distances deconstruction from these terms he reaffirms the necessity of returning to them at least under erasure . Derrida s necessity of returning to a term under erasure means that even though these terms are problematic we must use them until they can be effectively reformulated or replaced. The relevance of the tradition of negative theology to Derrida s preference for negative descriptions of deconstruction is the notion that a positive description of deconstruction would over determine the idea of deconstruction and would close off the openness that Derrida wishes to preserve for deconstruction. If Derrida were to positively define deconstruction as for example a critique then this would make the concept of critique immune to itself being deconstructed. Some new philosophy beyond deconstruction would then be required in order to encompass the notion of critique. Derrida states that Deconstruction is not a method and cannot be transformed into one . This is because deconstruction is not a mechanical operation. Derrida warns against considering deconstruction as a mechanical operation when he states that It is true that in certain circles university or cultural especially in the United States the technical and methodological metaphor that seems necessarily attached to the very word deconstruction has been able to seduce or lead astray . Commentator Richard Beardsworth explains that Derrida is careful to avoid this term method because it carries connotations of a procedural form of judgement. A thinker with a method has already decided how to proceed is unable to give him or herself up to the matter of thought in hand is a functionary of the criteria which structure his or her conceptual gestures. For Derrida ... this is irresponsibility itself. Thus to talk of a method in relation to deconstruction especially regarding its ethico political implications would appear to go directly against the current of Derrida s philosophical adventure. Beardsworth here explains that it would be irresponsible to undertake a deconstruction with a complete set of rules that need only be applied as a method to the object of deconstruction because this understanding would reduce deconstruction to a thesis of the reader that the text is then made to fit. This would be an irresponsible act of reading because it becomes a prejudicial procedure that only finds what it sets out to find. Derrida states that deconstruction is not a critique in the Kantian sense. This is because Kant defines the term critique as the opposite of dogmatism. For Derrida it is not possible to escape the dogmatic baggage of the language we use in order to perform a pure critique in the Kantian sense. Language is dogmatic because it is inescapably metaphysical. Derrida argues that language is inescapably metaphysical because it is made up of signifiers that only refer to that which transcends them the signified. citation needed In addition Derrida asks rhetorically Is not the idea of knowledge and of the acquisition of knowledge in itself metaphysical By this Derrida means that all claims to know something necessarily involve an assertion of the metaphysical type that something is the case somewhere. For Derrida the concept of neutrality is suspect and dogmatism is therefore involved in everything to a certain degree. Deconstruction can challenge a particular dogmatism and hence desediment dogmatism in general but it cannot escape all dogmatism all at once. Derrida states that deconstruction is not an analysis in the traditional sense. This is because the possibility of analysis is predicated on the possibility of breaking up the text being analysed into elemental component parts. Derrida argues that there are no self sufficient units of meaning in a text because individual words or sentences in a text can only be properly understood in terms of how they fit into the larger structure of the text and language itself. For more on Derrida s theory of meaning see the article on diffrance. Derrida states that his use of the word deconstruction first took place in a context in which structuralism was dominant and deconstruction s meaning is within this context. Derrida states that deconstruction is an antistructuralist gesture because s tructures were to be undone decomposed desedimented . At the same time deconstruction is also a structuralist gesture because it is concerned with the structure of texts. So deconstruction involves a certain attention to structures and tries to understand how an ensemble was constituted . As both a structuralist and an antistructuralist gesture deconstruction is tied up with what Derrida calls the structural problematic . The structural problematic for Derrida is the tension between genesis that which is in the essential mode of creation or movement and structure systems or complexes or static configurations . An example of genesis would be the sensory ideas from which knowledge is then derived in the empirical epistemology. An example of structure would be a binary opposition such as good and evil where the meaning of each element is established at least partly through its relationship to the other element. It is for this reason that Derrida distances his use of the term deconstruction from post structuralism a term that would suggest that philosophy could simply go beyond structuralism. Derrida states that the motif of deconstruction has been associated with post structuralism but that this term was a word unknown in France until its return from the United States . In his deconstruction of Husserl Derrida actually argues for the contamination of pure origins by the structures of language and temporality. Manfred Frank has even referred to Derrida s work as Neostructuralism identifying a distaste for the metaphysical concepts of domination and system . The popularity of the term deconstruction combined with the technical difficulty of Derrida s primary material on deconstruction and his reluctance to elaborate his understanding of the term has meant that many secondary sources have attempted to give a more straightforward explanation than Derrida himself ever attempted. Secondary definitions are therefore an interpretation of deconstruction by the person offering them rather than a summary of Derrida s actual position. Whenever deconstruction finds a nutshell a secure axiom or a pithy maxim the very idea is to crack it open and disturb this tranquility. Indeed that is a good rule of thumb in deconstruction. That is what deconstruction is all about its very meaning and mission if it has any. One might even say that cracking nutshells is what deconstruction is. In a nutshell. ...Have we not run up against a paradox and an aporia something contradictory ...the paralysis and impossibility of an aporia is just what impels deconstruction what rouses it out of bed in the morning... While in a sense it is impossibly difficult to define the impossibility has less to do with the adoption of a position or the assertion of a choice on deconstruction s part than with the impossibility of every is as such. Deconstruction begins as it were from a refusal of the authority or determining power of every is or simply from a refusal of authority in general. While such refusal may indeed count as a position it is not the case that deconstruction holds this as a sort of preference . page needed Deconstruction signifies a project of critical thought whose task is to locate and take apart those concepts which serve as the axioms or rules for a period of thought those concepts which command the unfolding of an entire epoch of metaphysics. Deconstruction is somewhat less negative than the Heideggerian or Nietzschean terms destruction or reversal it suggests that certain foundational concepts of metaphysics will never be entirely eliminated...There is no simple overcoming of metaphysics or the language of metaphysics. A survey of the secondary literature reveals a wide range of heterogeneous arguments. Particularly problematic are the attempts to give neat introductions to deconstruction by people trained in literary criticism who sometimes have little or no expertise in the relevant areas of philosophy that Derrida is working in. These secondary works e.g. Deconstruction for Beginners page needed and Deconstructions A User s Guide page needed have attempted to explain deconstruction while being academically criticized as too far removed from the original texts and Derrida s actual position. citation needed Derrida s observations have greatly influenced literary criticism and post structuralism. Derrida s method consisted of demonstrating all the forms and varieties of the originary complexity of semiotics and their multiple consequences in many fields. His way of achieving this was by conducting thorough careful sensitive and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts with an ear to what in those texts runs counter to their apparent systematicity structural unity or intended sense authorial genesis . By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways that this originary complexity which by definition cannot ever be completely known works its structuring and destructuring effects. Deconstruction denotes the pursuing of the meaning of a text to the point of exposing the supposed contradictions and internal oppositions upon which it is founded supposedly showing that those foundations are irreducibly complex unstable or impossible. It is an approach that may be deployed in philosophy in literary analysis and even in the analysis of scientific writings. Deconstruction generally tries to demonstrate that any text is not a discrete whole but contains several irreconcilable and contradictory meanings that any text therefore has more than one interpretation that the text itself links these interpretations inextricably that the incompatibility of these interpretations is irreducible and thus that an interpretative reading cannot go beyond a certain point. Derrida refers to this point as an aporia in the text thus deconstructive reading is termed aporetic. He insists that meaning is made possible by the relations of a word to other words within the network of structures that language is. Derrida initially resisted granting to his approach the overarching name deconstruction on the grounds that it was a precise technical term that could not be used to characterize his work generally. Nevertheless he eventually accepted that the term had come into common use to refer to his textual approach and Derrida himself increasingly began to use the term in this more general way. Derrida s deconstruction strategy is also used by postmodernists to locate meaning in a text rather than discover meaning due to the position that it has multiple readings. There is a focus on the deconstruction that denotes the tearing apart of a text to find arbitrary hierarchies and presuppositions for the purpose of tracing contradictions that shadow a text s coherence. Here the meaning of a text does not reside with the author or the author s intentions because it is dependent on the interaction between reader and text. Even the process of translation is also seen as transformative since it modifies the original even as it modifies the translating language. Derrida s lecture at Johns Hopkins University Structure Sign and Play in the Human Sciences often appears in collections as a manifesto against structuralism. Derrida s essay was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to structuralism and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist. Structuralism viewed language as a number of signs composed of a signified the meaning and a signifier the word itself . Derrida proposed that signs always referred to other signs existing only in relation to each other and there was therefore no ultimate foundation or centre. This is the basis of diffrance. Between the late s and the early s many thinkers were influenced by deconstruction including Paul de Man Geoffrey Hartman and J. Hillis Miller. This group came to be known as the Yale school and was especially influential in literary criticism. Derrida and Hillis Miller were subsequently affiliated with the University of California Irvine. Miller has described deconstruction this way Deconstruction is not a dismantling of the structure of a text but a demonstration that it has already dismantled itself. Its apparently solid ground is no rock but thin air. Arguing that law and politics cannot be separated the founders of the Critical Legal Studies Movement found it necessary to criticize the absence of the recognition of this inseparability at the level of theory. To demonstrate the indeterminacy of legal doctrine these scholars often adopt a method such as structuralism in linguistics or deconstruction in Continental philosophy to make explicit the deep structure of categories and tensions at work in legal texts and talk. The aim was to deconstruct the tensions and procedures by which they are constructed expressed and deployed. For example Duncan Kennedy in explicit reference to semiotics and deconstruction procedures maintains that various legal doctrines are constructed around the binary pairs of opposed concepts each of which has a claim upon intuitive and formal forms of reasoning that must be made explicit in their meaning and relative value and criticized. Self and other private and public subjective and objective freedom and control are examples of such pairs demonstrating the influence of opposing concepts on the development of legal doctrines throughout history. Deconstructive readings of history and sources have changed the entire discipline of history completely unsubstantiated and dogmatic . In Deconstructing History Alun Munslow examines history in what he argues is a postmodern age. He provides an introduction to the debates and issues of postmodernist history. He also surveys the latest research into the relationship between the past history and historical practice as well as articulating his own theoretical challenges. Jean Luc Nancy argues in his book The Inoperative Community for an understanding of community and society that is undeconstructable because it is prior to conceptualisation. Nancy s work is an important development of deconstruction because it takes the challenge of deconstruction seriously and attempts to develop an understanding of political terms that is undeconstructable and therefore suitable for a philosophy after Derrida. Simon Critchley an English philosopher argues in his book The Ethics of Deconstruction that Derrida s deconstruction is an intrinsically ethical practice. Critchley argues that deconstruction involves an openness to the Other that makes it ethical in the Levinasian understanding of the term. Jacques Derrida has had a great influence on contemporary political theory and political philosophy. Derrida s thinking has inspired Slavoj Zizek Richard Rorty Ernesto Laclau Judith Butler and many more contemporary theorists who have developed a deconstructive approach to politics. Because deconstruction examines the internal logic of any given text or discourse it has helped many authors to analyse the contradictions inherent in all schools of thought and as such it has proved revolutionary in political analysis particularly ideology critiques. page needed Richard Beardsworth developing from Critchley s Ethics of Deconstruction argues in his Derrida and the Political that deconstruction is an intrinsically political practice. He further argues that the future of deconstruction faces a perhaps undecidable choice between a theological approach and a technological approach represented first of all by the work of Bernard Stiegler. Derrida was involved in a number of high profile disagreements with prominent philosophers including Michel Foucault John Searle Willard Van Orman Quine Peter Kreeft and Jrgen Habermas. Most of the criticism of deconstruction were first articulated by these philosophers and repeated elsewhere. In the early s Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. citation needed Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida s deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida s papers in the collection Limited Inc. Searle did not consider Derrida s approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by paying any attention to it. Consequently some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle s statement that It would be a mistake to regard Derrida s discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions to which Derrida replied that that sentence was the only sentence of the reply to which I can subscribe . Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between analytic and Continental philosophies. The debate began in when in his paper Signature Event Context Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin s theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin s departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes force Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. Derrida argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a structure of absence the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints and by iterability the constraints on what can be said imposed by what has been said in the past . Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction non serious or parasitic speech wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres as governed by different structures of meaning or hadn t considered them due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida Reiterating the Differences A Reply to Derrida Searle argued that Derrida s critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin s theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin s inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida s proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This in turn caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with phenomenological perspectives on intentionality. Searle also argued that Derrida s disagreement with Austin turned on Derrida s having misunderstood Austin s type token distinction and having failed to understand Austin s concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derrida s continental phenomenological tradition was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange. Derrida in his response to Searle a b c ... in Limited Inc ridiculed Searle s positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searle s message could not be established Derrida suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a socit  responsabilit limite a limited liability company due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle s reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle reiterating that he found the constant appeal to normality in the analytical tradition to be problematic. In the debate Derrida praised Austin s work but argued that Austin is wrong to banish what Austin calls infelicities from the normal operation of language. One infelicity for instance occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is sincere or merely citational and therefore possibly ironic . Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily citational due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing and that language could not work at all without the ever present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for attempting to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker s inaccessible intention . Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow from a language whose significance is determined by historical linguistic context and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance Derrida argues cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention. Derrida argued against the constant appeal to normality in the analytical tradition of which Austin and Searle were paradigmatic examples. In the description of the structure called normal normative central ideal this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident marginal or parasitic. It cannot be and hence ought not to be and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty. In the analysis of so called normal cases one neither can nor ought in all theoretical rigor to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensably about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general. Derrida argued that it was problematic to establish the relation between nonfiction or standard discourse and fiction defined as its parasite for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction the simulacrum parasitism to take place and in so doing to de essentialize itself as it were . He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become what is nonfiction standard discourse what must it be and what does this name evoke once its fictionality or its fictionalization its transgressive parasitism is always possible and moreover by virtue of the very same words the same phrases the same grammar etc. This question is all the more indispensable since the rules and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of nonfiction standard discourse and its fictional parasites are not things found in nature but laws symbolic inventions or conventions institutions that in their very normality as well as in their normativity entail something of the fictional. In Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derrida s conclusion preposterous and stated that Derrida as far as I can tell does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts... Searle s reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate but to a mistranslation of the phrase il n y a pas dehors du texte There is no outside text which appears in Derrida s Of Grammatology. In The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity Jrgen Habermas criticized what he considered Derrida s opposition to rational discourse. Further in an essay on religion and religious language Habermas criticized Derrida s insistence on etymology and philology see Etymological fallacy . The American philosopher Walter A. Davis in Inwardness and Existence Subjectivity in and Hegel Heidegger Marx and Freud argues that both deconstruction and structuralism are prematurely arrested moments of a dialectical movement that issues from Hegelian unhappy consciousness . page needed Popular criticism of deconstruction intensified following the Sokal affair which many people took as an indicator of the quality of deconstruction as a whole despite the absence of Derrida from Sokal s follow up book Impostures Intellectuelles. Chip Morningstar holds a view critical of deconstruction believing it to be epistemologically challenged. He claims the humanities are subject to isolation and genetic drift due to their unaccountability to the world outside academia. During the Second International Conference on Cyberspace Santa Cruz California he reportedly heckled deconstructionists off the stage.

"85",85,"environmental economics","/wiki/Environmental_economics",TRUE,0,"field|","Environmental economics is a sub field of economics concerned with environmental issues","Environmental economics is a sub field of economics concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied topic due to growing environmental concerns in the twenty first century. Quoting from the National Bureau of Economic Research Environmental Economics program ... Environmental Economics ... undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world ... . Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution water quality toxic substances solid waste and global warming. Environmental economics is distinguished from ecological economics in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving natural capital. One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought with ecological economists emphasizing strong sustainability and rejecting the proposition that natural capital can be substituted by human made capital. Central to environmental economics is the concept of market failure. Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley Shogren and White A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment. Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off. Common forms of market failure include externalities non excludability and non rivalry. citation needed An externality exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance water seepage in residential buildings occurring in upper floors affect the lower floors. Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting. better source needed Or a firm emitting pollution will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others. As a result pollution may occur in excess of the socially efficient level which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by Kenneth Arrow and James Meade is provided by Heller and Starrett who define an externality as a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of Pareto efficiency . In economic terminology externalities are examples of market failures in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome. When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource the resource is either called a common property resource when there is rivalry for the resource such that one person s use of the resource reduces others opportunity to use the resource or a public good when use of the resource is non rivalrous . In either case of non exclusion market allocation is likely to be inefficient. These challenges have long been recognized. Hardin s concept of the tragedy of the commons popularized the challenges involved in non exclusion and common property. Commons refers to the environmental asset itself common property resource or common pool resource refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams and open access implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns. The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons they can end up expending too much effort over harvesting a resource e.g. a fishery . Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions users of an open access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights leading to environmental degradation. See however Ostrom s work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons. The mitigation of climate change effects is an example of a public good where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non rival and non excludable. Such efforts are non rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys. They are non excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country s incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can free ride off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago Swedish economist Knut Wicksell first discussed how public goods can be under provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them. Nitrogen Cycle Water Cycle Carbon Cycle Oxygen Cycle Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from natural resources or ecosystem services see the nature section of ecological economics . Non use values include existence option and bequest values. For example some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children. Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior such as the cost of taking recreational trips or using hedonic methods in which values are estimated based on observed prices. Non use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as contingent valuation or choice modelling. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment willingness to pay or their willingness to accept WTA compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. Hedonic pricing examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices traveling expenses and payments to visit parks. Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include Environmental economics is related to ecological economics but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems many of which are related to so called market failures circumstances wherein the invisible hand of economics is unreliable. Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of ecology. Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to environmental problems and focuses more explicitly on long term environmental sustainability and issues of scale. Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a price system ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use money as a primary arbiter of decisions. These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings. Another context in which externalities apply is when globalization permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with biodiversity to undercut prices of another who is creating a race to the bottom in regulations and conservation. This in turn may cause loss of natural capital with consequent erosion water purity problems diseases desertification and other outcomes which are not efficient in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of sustainable development and its political relation the anti globalization movement. Environmental economics was once distinct from resource economics. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation . It is now difficult to distinguish environmental and natural resource economics as separate fields as the two became associated with sustainability. Many of the more radical green economists split off to work on an alternate political economy. Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of natural capitalism and environmental finance which could be said to be two sub branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production and the value of biodiversity to humans respectively. The theory of natural capitalism Hawken Lovins Lovins goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with physical capital. The more radical Green economists reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new political economy beyond capitalism or communism that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment acknowledging that economy is three fifths of ecology Mike Nickerson. These more radical approaches would imply changes to money supply and likely also a bioregional democracy so that political economic and ecological environmental limits were all aligned and not subject to the arbitrage normally possible under capitalism. An emerging sub field of environmental economics studies its intersection with development economics. Dubbed envirodevonomics by Michael Greenstone and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper Envirodevonomics A Research Agenda for a Young Field the sub field is primarily interested in studying why environmental quality is so poor in developing countries. A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country s GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics including market failures externalities and willingness to pay may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries such as political issues lack of infrastructure or inadequate financing tools among many others. In the field of law and economics environmental law is studied from an economic perspective. The economic analysis of environmental law studies instruments such as zoning expropriation licensing third party liability safety regulation mandatory insurance and criminal sanctions. A book by Michael Faure surveys this literature. The main academic and professional organizations for the discipline of Environmental Economics are the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists AERE and the European Association for Environmental and Resource Economics EAERE . The main academic and professional organization for the discipline of Ecological Economics is the International Society for Ecological Economics ISEE .

This includes all activities of the forward and reverse flows of products information and services between the point of origin and the point of consumption. It is the aim to create a sustainable company value using a balance of economic and environmental efficiency. Green logistics has its origin in the mid s and was a concept to characterize logistics systems and approaches that use advanced technology and equipment to minimize environmental damage during operations. Organizations have to face changes in the coming years. In addition to increasing diversity and dynamics environmental issues become more important. Social political and economic demands for sustainable development force organizations to reduce the effect on the environment of their supply chains and to develop sustainable transport and supply chain strategies. There are strong interactions between logistics environment and natural resources. In addition the approach of logistics is interdisciplinary holistic and cross company Realising environmental objectives can be done in synergy with other strategic and financial goals. This is the basis of the great potential of this new logistics problem and challenge. The ecological concern in logistics determines how far the logistics or the supply chain of a company is faced with the issue of environmental protection and resource conservation. Basically a supply chain is affected of various influencing factors in this context. The main influencing factors are the stakeholders of the organization and the rising costs of energy and commodity. Some of the key stakeholders in this context are There is also the pressure of lenders investors insurers and investors. Indications of this are new forms of investment in the capital market such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index that tracks the stock performance of the world s leading companies in terms of economic environmental and social criteria. The dimension of ecological concern of a company is the product of these complex and varying factors. Logistics has a whole range of measures to protect the environment and resources. Some are new others long known. These actions can be assigned to different levels maturity range scope capital expenditure and resource requirements. Corresponding to the holistic approach of green logistics logistics has five starting points to implement measures for environmental protection and resource conservation Examples The first four levels form a hierarchy and influence each other sequentially. Decisions on one level define the scope for further decisions on the following levels. Decisions at higher levels reduce the freedom for the following levels. Example The determination of the packing mass of a product on the Level one defines the volume and weight of a product and therefore the maximum number of items per carrier e.g. container . Thus the decision made on level one influences the maximum capacity of a container. The effects on the environment measured as carbon dioxide CO emissions per transported product therefore are strongly influenced by the decisions made on level one.

It is the most abundantly available raw material on the Earth for the production of biofuels mainly bio ethanol. It is composed of carbohydrate polymers cellulose hemicellulose and an aromatic polymer lignin . These carbohydrate polymers contain different sugar monomers six and five carbon sugars and they are tightly bound to lignin. Lignocellulosic biomass can be broadly classified into virgin biomass waste biomass and energy crops. Virgin biomass includes all naturally occurring terrestrial plants such as trees bushes and grass. Waste biomass is produced as a low value byproduct of various industrial sectors such as agriculture corn stover sugarcane bagasse straw etc. and forestry saw mill and paper mill discards . Energy crops are crops with high yield of lignocellulosic biomass produced to serve as a raw material for production of second generation biofuel examples include switch grass Panicum virgatum and Elephant grass. Many crops are of interest for their ability to provide high yields of biomass and can be harvested multiple times each year. These include poplar trees and Miscanthus giganteus. The premier energy crop is sugarcane which is a source of the readily fermentable sucrose and the lignocellulosic by product bagasse. Lignocellulosic biomass is the feedstock for the pulp and paper industry. This energy intensive industry focuses on the separation of the lignin and cellulosic fractions of the biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass in the form of wood fuel has a long history as a source of energy. Since the middle of the th century the interest of biomass as a precursor to liquid fuels has increased. To be specific the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol is an attractive route to fuels that supplements the fossil fuels. Biomass can be a carbon neutral source of energy in the long run. However depending on the source of biomass it will not be carbon neutral in the short term. For instance if the biomass is derived from trees the time period to regrow the tree on the order of decades will see a net increase in carbon dioxide in the earth s atmosphere upon the combustion of lignocellulosic ethanol. However if woody material from annual crop residue is used the fuel could be considered carbon neutral. Aside from ethanol many other lignocellulose derived fuels are of potential interest including butanol dimethylfuran and gamma Valerolactone. One barrier to the production of ethanol from biomass is that the sugars necessary for fermentation are trapped inside the lignocellulose. Lignocellulose has evolved to resist degradation and to confer hydrolytic stability and structural robustness to the cell walls of the plants. This robustness or recalcitrance is attributable to the crosslinking between the polysaccharides cellulose and hemicellulose and the lignin via ester and ether linkages. Ester linkages arise between oxidized sugars the uronic acids and the phenols and phenylpropanols functionalities of the lignin. To extract the fermentable sugars one must first disconnect the celluloses from the lignin and then use acid or enzymatic methods to hydrolyze the newly freed celluloses to break them down into simple monosaccharides. Another challenge to biomass fermentation is the high percentage of pentoses in the hemicellulose such as xylose or wood sugar. Unlike hexoses such as glucose pentoses are difficult to ferment. The problems presented by the lignin and hemicellulose fractions are the foci of much contemporary research. A large sector of research into the exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for bio ethanol focuses particularly on the fungus Trichoderma reesei known for its cellulolytic abilities. Multiple avenues are being explored including the design of an optimised cocktail of cellulases and hemicellulases isolated from T. reesei as well as genetic engineering based strain improvement to allow the fungus to simply be placed in the presence of lignocellulosic biomass and break down the matter into D glucose monomers. Strain improvement methods have led to strains capable of producing significantly more cellulases than the original QMa isolate certain industrial strains are known to produce up to g of cellulase per litre of fungus thus allowing for maximal extraction of sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. These sugars can then be fermented leading to bio ethanol.",FALSE

It is therefore sometimes also referred to as regional national or economy wide material flow analysis. Material flow accounting provides economy wide data on material use. Through international standardization this data has become reliable and comparable across countries. Increasingly the data are also being made available in medium to long term time series allowing for the analysis of past trends as well as potential future developments. Material flow accounts provide information on the material inputs into the changes in material stock within and the material outputs in the form of exports to other economies or discharges to the environment of an economy. Material flow accounting can be used in national planning especially for scarce resources and also allows for forecasting. The method can be used to assess environmental burdens associated with the economic activities of a nation and to determine how material intensive an economy is. The principle concept underlying MFA is a simple model of this interrelation between the economy and the environment in which the economy is an embedded subsystem of the environment. Similar to living beings this subsystem is dependent on a constant throughput of materials and energy. Raw materials water and air are extracted from the natural system as inputs transformed into products and finally re transferred to the natural system as outputs waste and emissions . In order to highlight the similarity to natural metabolic processes the terms industrial or societal metabolism have been introduced. In MFA studies for a region or on a national level the flows of materials between the natural environment and the economy are analyzed and quantified on a physical level. The focus may be on individual substances e.g. Cadmium flows specific materials or bulk material flows e.g. steel and steel scrap flows within an economy . Researchers in this field are organized in the Socio Economic Metabolism SEM section of the International Society for Industrial Ecology ISIE . Statistics related to material flow accounting are usually compiled by national statistical offices using economic agricultural and trade statistics measuring the exchange of material between different products available in an economy.  Aside from calculating the net additions to stock NAS as a balancing item flows within the economy are not considered advances are currently being made in the field of dynamic stock modelling . MFA covers all solid gaseous and liquid materials mobilized by humans or by their livestock with the exception of bulk water and air. The unit of measurement is most commonly metric tonnes per year t a . Flows are distinguished by whether they are extracted domestically domestic extraction DE or are trade flows imports or exports . Materials are most commonly grouped according to four main material categories biomass fossil energy carriers metals and non metallic minerals. The former category may be further differentiated by type of use into industrial and construction minerals. It is very important to note that MFA seeks to provide a complete picture of an economy s material use so that materials are included in these accounts irrespective of whether or not they have direct market value. The most prominent non market flows covered by MFA are grazed biomass and used crop residues as well as waste rock extracted during mining activities. In these material flows accounted for of global extraction. The data collected in MFA is used to calculate several different standardized indicators Direct Material Input DMI is a measure of the total material inputs into an economy and is calculated as the sum of domestic extraction DE and imports. The Physical Trade Balance PTB is a measure of net imports and is calculated as the difference between imports and exports. Reflecting that material and money flow in opposite directions during trade this is a contrast to the monetary trade balance which calculates net exports. Domestic Material Consumption DMC is a measure of apparent consumption and calculated from domestic extraction plus imports minus exports or DE plus PTB . Economy wide MFA is a satellite system to the system of national accounts and provides a rich empirical database for analytical studies. More information on how the statistics are collected under what legal framework and how they are defined is available on Economy wide material flow accounts.

It is a long term methodological structure that incorporates profit environmental stewardship fairness health business and familial aspects on a farm setting. It is defined by integral aspects which are economic profit environmental stewardship and social responsibility. Sustainability focuses on the business process and practice of a farm in general rather than a specific agricultural product. The integrated economic environmental and social principles are incorporated into a triple bottom line TBL when the general impacts of the farm are assessed. Unlike a traditional approach where the profit margin is the single major factor Agriculture sustainability is also involved with the social and environmental factors. The phrase sustainable agriculture was reportedly coined by the Australian agricultural scientist Gordon McClymont. Wes Jackson is credited with the first publication of the expression in his book New Roots for Agriculture. The term became popular in the late s. It has been defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site specific application that will last over the long term for example to satisfy human food and fiber needs to enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends to make the most efficient use of non renewable and on farm resources and integrate natural biological cycles and controls to sustain the economic viability of farm operations and to enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole. There are several key principles associated with sustainability in agriculture Sustainable agriculture can be understood as an ecosystem approach to agriculture. Practices that can cause long term damage to soil include excessive tilling of the soil leading to erosion and irrigation without adequate drainage leading to salinization . Long term experiments have provided some of the best data on how various practices affect soil properties essential to sustainability. In the United States a federal agency USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service specializes in providing technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation and production agriculture as compatible goals. The most important factors for an individual site are climate soil nutrients and water. Of the four water and soil quality and quantity are most amenable to human intervention through time and labor. When farmers grow and harvest crops they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced yields. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non renewable resources such as natural gas used in converting atmospheric nitrogen into synthetic fertilizer or mineral ores e.g. phosphate . Possible sources of nitrogen that would in principle be available indefinitely include The last option was proposed in the s but is only gradually becoming feasible. Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited. More realistic and often overlooked options include long term crop rotations returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands returning lost nutrients indefinitely such as the flooding of the Nile the long term use of biochar and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests drought or lack of nutrients. Crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices. In some areas sufficient rainfall is available for crop growth but many other areas require irrigation. For irrigation systems to be sustainable they require proper management to avoid salinization and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise the water source effectively becomes a non renewable resource. Improvements in water well drilling technology and submersible pumps combined with the development of drip irrigation and low pressure pivots have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However this progress has come at a price. In many areas such as the Ogallala Aquifer the water is being used faster than it can be replenished. Several steps must be taken to develop drought resistant farming systems even in normal years with average rainfall. These measures include both policy and management actions Indicators for sustainable water resource development are Soil erosion is fast becoming one of the world s severe problems. It is estimated that more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa s soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates. Soil erosion is occurring worldwide. The phenomenon is being called peak soil as improper soil management techniques in some areas of the world are jeopardizing humanity s ability to grow food in the present and in the future. Without efforts to improve soil management practices the availability of arable soil will become increasingly problematic. Intensive agriculture reduces the carbon level in soil impairing soil structure crop growth and ecosystem functioning and accelerating climate change. Soil management techniques include no till farming keyline design windbreaks to reduce wind erosion incorporating carbon containing organic matter back into fields reducing chemical fertilizers and protecting soil from water run off. Phosphate is a primary component in chemical fertilizer. It is the second most important nutrient for plant after nitrogen and is often a limiting factor. It is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields. Phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis energy transfer signal transduction macromolecular biosynthesis and respiration. It is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation and can increase disease resistance. Phosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms and makes up approximately . of soil biomass. However only . of that phosphorus present can be absorbed by plants. This is due to poor solubility and phosphorus high reactivity with elements in the soil such as aluminum calcium and iron causing the phosphorus to be fixed. Long term use of phosphate containing chemical fertilizers cause eutrophication and deplete soil fertility so people have looked to other sources. An alternative is rock phosphate a natural source already in some soils. In India there are almost million tons of rock phosphate. However rock phosphate is a non renewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use reserves are expected to be exhausted in years peak phosphorus will occur in about . This is expected to increase food prices as phosphate fertilizer costs increase. A way to make rock phosphate more effective and last longer is to implement microbial inoculants such as phosphate solubilizing microorganisms known as PSMs. A source of these PSMs is compost or the recycling of human and animal waste. Specific PSMs can be added to soil. These solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants. When these PSMs are present there has been an increase in crop growth particularly in terms of shoot height dry biomass and grain yield. Phosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of mycorrhizae in the soil. Mycorrhiza is a type of mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and fungi which are well equipped to absorb nutrients including phosphorus in soil. These fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum calcium and iron. Mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus. As the global population increases and demand for food increases there is pressure on land resources. In land use planning and management considering the impacts of land use changes on factors such as soil erosion can support long term agricultural sustainability as shown by a study of Wadi Ziqlab a dry area in the Middle East where farmers graze livestock and grow olives vegetables and grains. Looking back over the th century shows that for people in poverty following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances. Currently increased land degradation in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity. Land is a finite resource on Earth. And although expansion of agricultural land can decrease biodiversity and contribute to deforestation the picture is complex for instance a study examining the introduction of sheep by Norse settlers Vikings to the Faroe Islands of the North Atlantic concluded that over time the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development along with reclamation of wetlands and conversion of forest to cultivation resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion. Many tools will be called upon to offset these projections. In Europe one such tool is a geo spatial data system called SoilConsWeb which is being developed to inform soil conservation minded decision making within agricultural sectors and other areas of land management. Energy is used all the way down the food chain from farm to fork. In industrial agriculture energy is used in on farm mechanisation food processing storage and transportation processes. It has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices. Oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals. The International Energy Agency projects higher prices of non renewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted. It may therefore decrease global food security unless action is taken to decouple fossil fuel energy from food production with a move towards energy smart agricultural systems including renewable energy. The use of solar powered irrigation in Pakistan has come to be recognized as a leading example of energy use in creating a closed system for water irrigation in agricultural activity. Crop drying may utilize solar energy where permissible and cost effective. Socioeconomic aspects of sustainability are also partly understood. Regarding less concentrated farming the best known analysis is Netting s study on smallholder systems through history. Given the finite supply of natural resources at any specific cost and location agriculture that is inefficient or damaging to needed resources may eventually exhaust the available resources or the ability to afford and acquire them. It may also generate negative externality such as pollution as well as financial and production costs. There are several studies incorporating these negative externalities in an economic analysis concerning ecosystem services biodiversity land degradation and sustainable land management. These include The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study led by Pavan Sukhdev and the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative which seeks to establish an economic cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture. The way that crops are sold must be accounted for in the sustainability equation. Food sold locally does not require additional energy for transportation including consumers . Food sold at a remote location whether at a farmers market or the supermarket incurs a different set of energy cost for materials labour and transport. Pursuing sustainable agriculture results in many localized benefits. Having the opportunities to sell products directly to consumers rather than at wholesale or commodity prices allows farmers to bring in optimal profit. Triple bottom line frameworks including social and environmental aspects alongside the financial show that a sustainable company can be technologically and economically feasible. For this to happen growth in material consumption and population need to be slowed down and there has to be a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use. To make that transition long and short term goals will need to be balanced enhancing equity and quality of life. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice. Two of the many possible practices of sustainable agriculture are crop rotation and soil amendment both designed to ensure that crops being cultivated can obtain the necessary nutrients for healthy growth. Soil amendments would include using locally available compost from community recycling centers. These community recycling centers help produce the compost needed by the local organic farms. Using community recycling from yard and kitchen waste utilizes a local area s commonly available resources. These resources in the past were thrown away into large waste disposal sites are now used to produce low cost organic compost for organic farming. Other practices includes growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources. This system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil. Nitrogen fixation from legumes for example used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth helps to allow the land to be reused annually. Legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest. Monoculture a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field is a very widespread practice but there are questions about its sustainability especially if the same crop is grown every year. Today it is realized to get around this problem local cities and farms can work together to produce the needed compost for the farmers around them. This combined with growing a mixture of crops polyculture sometimes reduces disease or pest problems but polyculture has rarely if ever been compared to the more widespread practice of growing different crops in successive years crop rotation with the same overall crop diversity. Such methods may also support sustainable weed management in that the development of herbicide resistant weeds is reduced. Cropping systems that include a variety of crops polyculture and or rotation may also replenish nitrogen if legumes are included and may also use resources such as sunlight water or nutrients more efficiently Field Crops Res. . Replacing a natural ecosystem with a few specifically chosen plant varieties reduces the genetic diversity found in wildlife and makes the organisms susceptible to widespread disease. The Great Irish Famine is a well known example of the dangers of monoculture. In practice there is no single approach to sustainable agriculture as the precise goals and methods must be adapted to each individual case. There may be some techniques of farming that are inherently in conflict with the concept of sustainability but there is widespread misunderstanding on effects of some practices. Today the growth of local farmers markets offer small farms the ability to sell the products that they have grown back to the cities that they got the recycled compost from. This will help move people away from the slash and burn or slash and char techniques that are the characteristic feature of shifting cultivation. These are often cited as inherently destructive yet slash and burn cultivation has been practiced in the Amazon for at least years. Serious deforestation did not begin until the s largely as the result of Brazilian government programs and policies. There are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry. Some of the key tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called paddocks lowering stock density and moving the stock between paddocks frequently. The increased production of nourishment while simultaneously contributing a positive effect on natural and social investment is a prospect of sustainable agriculture. Sustainable Intensification encompasses specific agriculture methodologies that increase production and at the same time help in improving environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations as of late the goal is to create an interrelation between agriculture and landscape. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methodologies by placing specific importance on broader environmental and social outcomes. The concept of SI has been gaining traction across farms on the globe. By the year it was predicted in nations a combined total of million farms adopted an agriculture substitution redesign threshold because of the utilization of SI concepts. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is million ha of land.That amount of land is equal to of farms worldwide. In light of concerns about food security human population growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high crop yields while maintaining soil health and ecosystem services. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of synthetic non renewable inputs whilst maintaining or even boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in the globally important irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that in relation to pest management at least promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by whilst delivering a yield advantage compared with standard practice. Soil steaming can be used as an ecological alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization. Different methods are available to induce steam into the soil in order to kill pests and increase soil health. Solarizing is based on the same principle used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests. Certain crops act as natural biofumigants releasing pest suppressing compounds. Mustard radishes and other plants in the brassica family are best known for this effect. There exist varieties of mustard shown to be almost as effective as synthetic fumigants at a similar or lesser cost. A farm that is able to produce perpetually yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is over application of synthetic fertilizer or animal manures which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters eutrophication . The other extreme can also be undesirable as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to rainforest destruction as in the case of slash and burn farming for livestock feed. In Asia specific land for sustainable farming is about . acres which includes land for animal fodder cereals productions lands for some cash crops and even recycling of related food crops. In some cases even a small unit of aquaculture is also included in this number AARI . Sustainability affects overall production which must increase to meet the increasing food and fiber requirements as the world s human population expands to a projected . billion people in . Increased production may come from creating new farmland which may ameliorate carbon dioxide emissions if done through reclamation of desert as in Israel and Palestine or may worsen emissions if done through slash and burn farming as in Brazil. There is not a lot of data on the environmental and health costs that are caused by agriculture influence on other segments the misuse of natural resources is one such example. These undesirable outcomes are labeled as externalities. Their costs are not part of market prices because they are non market issues. Negative externalities occur because of market failures where a contaminator is penalized for the damaged caused to the environment these costs that are never paid are external costs. In the agriculture sector these externalities have four aspects the cost of them is ignored by the unlawful party they happen within long intervals susceptible populations with little to no political or decision altering power are negatively affected the source of the external factor is not always deduced. This lack of concise information flow means that the economic cost of the externalities is debated in the agricultural industry. As a result of this modern agriculture has contributed to increased environmental and health issues documented cases of these issues are nations such as Ecuador China Germany the Philippines the UK as well as the USA. These developments have made nations contemplate what the best and most efficient systems of agriculture are. In the Philippians for example methodologies free of pesticide contribute to net social benefits. Externalities of pesticide use in China are responsible for . billion dollars cost per year because of the increased need for health services to the general population as well as negative impacts on biodiversity. Another example is in Ecuador where individuals out of are killed because of pesticide use. An integrated pest management system was introduced stopping the negative health effects and at the same time creating economic profit. Based on all these aforementioned examples and notions all agricultural plans have an environmental cost on some basic level. This can be used to deduce the methods that are sustainable and the ones that are not. Agricultural sustainability thus depends on size of the area and the standards of that specific location an effective baseline needs to be implemented for agricultural sustainability to function. An agricultural procedure may be sustainable if the externalities are low however this definition does not encompass all the values in the procedure and the potential effect that those values may have on the available resources. As the Earth is entering the Anthropocene an epoch characterized by human impacts such as climate change agriculture and agricultural development are at risk. Agriculture has an enormous environmental footprint and is simultaneously leading to huge amounts of environmental changes globally and being hugely impacted by these global changes. Additionally if the human population increase cannot be slowed e.g. with better provision of family planning a massive increase in food production will be required. This is complicated by the fact that the Earth is undergoing rising amounts of environmental risks. Sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population while successfully operating within the changing environmental conditions. In the United Nations reported on Organic Agriculture and Food Security stating that using organic and sustainable agriculture could be used as a tool to reach global food security without expanding land usage and reducing environmental impacts. Another way to define sustainable agriculture is to give attention to the human and environmental aspects because of the turn to a more unsustainable way of farming in U.S. agriculture. During the Great Depression in the United States many farming families were living in subhuman and hungry conditions and treated sustainability as a resource input and food output equation. Though conditions have improved the farming has not as much done so. There has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done. Although global food security would most likely not drastically fall these practices would impact first hand local rural farming communities making them unable to feed themselves and their families. The social scientist Charles Kellogg has stated that In a final effort exploited people pass their suffering to the land. This turn to more unsustainable farming has seen suffering for many people. For if something is sustainable it should be that way in all aspects of it not just the crop yield or soil health. It has been seen in the developing country of Bangladesh the starving of rural farming communities due to their unsustainable farming methods. Sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously feed its constituent populations. There are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers profits better communities and continue sustainable practices. For example in Uganda Genetically Modified Organisms GMOs were originally illegal however under stressful circumstances where Banana Bacterial Wilt BBW has the potential to wipe out of yield they decided to explore GMOs as a possible solution. Therefore as a result of the banana crisis in Uganda caused by the BBW the government issued the National Biotechnology and Biosafety bill which will allow scientists that are part of the National Banana Research Program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms. This effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion live off the food they grow themselves and it will keep their economy in check because their main sources of produce will remain stable. Women in the agriculture sustainability scene come from numerous backgrounds including academic and labour experience settings. The interrelations of the environment public policy people s behaviour finance as well as the earth in general are all aspects of sustainability that women in the field recognize as important to feed the world. In the past years in the United States the number of women farm operators has tripled. Today women operate percent of farms compared to five percent in . Much of the growth is due to women farming outside the male dominated field of conventional agriculture . In community supported agriculture women represent percent of farm operators and percent of organic farmers. With the change of laws in land ownership over the past century women are now allowed all the same freedom of land ownership that men have. Sustainable agriculture has become a topic of interest in the international policy arena especially with regards to its potential to reduce the risks associated with a changing climate and growing human population. The Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy. The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience. It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade including in national research and development budgets land rehabilitation economic incentives and infrastructure improvement. Most agricultural professionals agree that there is a moral obligation to pursue the goal of sustainability. The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal. Because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. The best way to create policy for agriculture is to be free of any bias. A good review would be done with practical wisdom a virtue identified by Aristotle distinguishing practical wisdom from scientific knowledge this coming from Nichomachean Ethics. The science of agriculture is called agronomy the root of this word relating to scientific law. Although agriculture may not fit well under scientific law and may not be designed to be treated as an Aristotelian scientific knowledge but more practical wisdom. Practical wisdom requires recognition of past failures in agriculture to better attain a more sustainable agricultural system. The use of available city space e.g. rooftop gardens community gardens garden sharing and other forms of urban agriculture for cooperative food production may be able to contribute to sustainability. A recent idea is to create large urban technical facilities for Vertical farming. Potential advantages include year round production isolation from pests and diseases controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs. Increasing threats of climate change have influenced cities and public officials are thinking more proactively about the ways they can deliver services and food more efficiently. The environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people take back their connection to fresh food. This raises questions however about the excess environmental costs associated with local farming vs more large scale operations which offer food security around the world. There are several key debates involving sustainable agriculture The main debate on how sustainable agriculture might be achieved centers around two different approaches an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach. The ecocentric approach emphasizes no or low growth levels of human development and focuses on organic and biodynamic farming techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns and resource allocation and usage. The technocentric approach argues that sustainability can be attained through a variety of strategies from the view that state led modification of the industrial system like conservation oriented farming systems should be implemented to the argument that biotechnology is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food. There are different scientific communities that are looking at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two separate lenses multifunctional agriculture MFA and ecosystem services ES . While both of these frameworks are similar they look at the function of agriculture in different lights. Those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farm centered approaches and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity. The central argument of MFA is that agriculture has other functions aside from the production of food and fiber and therefore agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise. These additional functions include renewable natural resource management and conservation of landscape and biodiversity. On the other hand ES focuses on service centered approaches and defines function as the provision of services to human beings. Specifically ES posits that individuals and society as a whole receive benefits from ecosystems which are called ecosystem services. Within the field of sustainable agriculture the services that ecosystems provide include pollination soil formation and nutrient cycling all of which are necessary functions for the production of food. Since World War II dominant models of agriculture in the United States and the entire national food system have been characterized by a focus on monetary profitability at the expense of social and environmental integrity. In sustainable agriculture changes in lower rates of soil and nutrient loss improved soil structure and higher levels of beneficial microorganisms are not quick. The changes are not immediately evident to the operator when using sustainable agriculture. In conventional agriculture the benefits are easily visible with no weeds pests etc. and the process of externalization hides the costs to soil and ecosystems around it. A major barrier to sustainable agriculture is the lack of knowledge of its benefits. Many benefits are not visible so they are often unknown. Not all geographic regions lend themselves easily to sustainable agriculture. While all parts of the world with human population need food to survive many of these places are located in climates that make food production difficult. In Nunavik which is located in northern Canada it was discovered that the sustainable agricultural development needed to provide its native population with better nutrition would be difficult to adopt due to the regions isolation and arctic climate. Sustainable agriculture in regions where resources are scarce can be difficult due to the restrictions on the productive abilities of the area. Certain areas lack fertile soil to grow crops others lack the technology to produce models for sustainability and some do not have enough water for agricultural upkeep. The technological advancement of the past few decades have allowed access to these areas and the means to develop sustainable agriculture in some of these previously obstructed regions. The implementation of greenhouses has been an effective method in overcoming the geographic barriers in certain parts of the world. For example Nepal has implemented greenhouses to deal with its high altitude and mountainous regions. Greenhouses have also been used to provide sustainable agriculture to arid climates in places such as Africa and Mexico. Greenhouses allow for greater crop production because of increased humidity and also use less water since it is a closed system. Desalination techniques have been developed to allow greater access to fresh water in areas that have historically had limited access. The desalination process turns salt water into fresh water and will allow the irrigation of crops to continue without making a harmful impact on the water supply. While desalination can prove to be an effective tool to provide fresh water to areas that need it to sustain agriculture it requires money and resources. regions of China have been considering large scale desalination in order to increase access to water but the current cost of the desalination process makes it impractical. Even though most of farmers who were interviewed accepted the notion climate change was happening just a small segment believed that it was human related. Few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it. Some of the farmers were worried that a suggested carbon pollution reduction plan would incorporate the agricultural sector into it. As well farmers where suspicious of numerous government related activities seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers. Efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community however these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. Some foresee a true sustainable steady state economy that may be very different from today s greatly reduced energy usage minimal ecological footprint fewer consumer packaged goods local purchasing with short food supply chains little processed foods more home and community gardens etc.",FALSE
"91",91,"biodiesel","/wiki/Biodiesel",FALSE,0,"null","Biodiesel refers to a vegetable oil or animal fat based diesel fuel consisting of long chain alkyl methyl ethyl or propyl esters","Biodiesel refers to a vegetable oil or animal fat based diesel fuel consisting of long chain alkyl methyl ethyl or propyl esters. Biodiesel is typically made by chemically reacting lipids e.g. vegetable oil soybean oil animal fat tallow with an alcohol producing fatty acid esters. Biodiesel is a drop in biofuel and thus meant to be used in standard diesel engines and is thus distinct from the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines. Biodiesel can be used alone or blended with petrodiesel in any proportions. Biodiesel blends can also be used as heating oil. The National Biodiesel Board USA also has a technical definition of biodiesel as a mono alkyl ester. Blends of biodiesel and conventional hydrocarbon based diesel are products most commonly distributed for use in the retail diesel fuel marketplace. Much of the world uses a system known as the B factor to state the amount of biodiesel in any fuel mix Blends of biodiesel and lower can be used in diesel equipment with no or only minor modifications although certain manufacturers do not extend warranty coverage if equipment is damaged by these blends. The B to B blends are covered by the ASTM D specification. Biodiesel can also be used in its pure form B but may require certain engine modifications to avoid maintenance and performance problems. Blending B with petroleum diesel may be accomplished by Biodiesel can be used in pure form B or may be blended with petroleum diesel at any concentration in most injection pump diesel engines. New extreme high pressure psi common rail engines have strict factory limits of B or B depending on manufacturer. Biodiesel has different solvent properties from petrodiesel and will degrade natural rubber gaskets and hoses in vehicles mostly vehicles manufactured before although these tend to wear out naturally and most likely will have already been replaced with FKM which is nonreactive to biodiesel. Biodiesel has been known to break down deposits of residue in the fuel lines where petrodiesel has been used. As a result fuel filters may become clogged with particulates if a quick transition to pure biodiesel is made. Therefore it is recommended to change the fuel filters on engines and heaters shortly after first switching to a biodiesel blend. Since the passage of the Energy Policy Act of biodiesel use has been increasing in the United States. In the UK the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation obliges suppliers to include renewable fuel in all transport fuel sold in the UK by . For road diesel this effectively means biodiesel B . In Chrysler then part of DaimlerChrysler released the Jeep Liberty CRD diesels from the factory into the European market with biodiesel blends indicating at least partial acceptance of biodiesel as an acceptable diesel fuel additive. In DaimlerChrysler indicated its intention to increase warranty coverage to biodiesel blends if biofuel quality in the United States can be standardized. The Volkswagen Group has released a statement indicating that several of its vehicles are compatible with B and B made from rape seed oil and compatible with the EN standard. The use of the specified biodiesel type in its cars will not void any warranty. Mercedes Benz does not allow diesel fuels containing greater than biodiesel B due to concerns about production shortcomings . Any damages caused by the use of such non approved fuels will not be covered by the Mercedes Benz Limited Warranty. Starting in the city of Halifax Nova Scotia decided to update its bus system to allow the fleet of city buses to run entirely on a fish oil based biodiesel. This caused the city some initial mechanical issues but after several years of refining the entire fleet had successfully been converted. In McDonald s of UK announced it would start producing biodiesel from the waste oil byproduct of its restaurants. This fuel would be used to run its fleet. The Chevy Cruze Clean Turbo Diesel direct from the factory will be rated for up to B blend of biodiesel regular diesel biodiesel compatibility British train operating company Virgin Trains claimed to have run the UK s first biodiesel train which was converted to run on petrodiesel and biodiesel. The British Royal Train on September completed its first ever journey run on biodiesel fuel supplied by Green Fuels Ltd. Prince Charles and Green Fuels managing director James Hygate were the first passengers on a train fueled entirely by biodiesel fuel. Since the Royal Train has operated successfully on B biodiesel . Similarly a state owned short line railroad in eastern Washington ran a test of a biodiesel petrodiesel blend during the summer of purchasing fuel from a biodiesel producer sited along the railroad tracks. The train will be powered by biodiesel made in part from canola grown in agricultural regions through which the short line runs. Also in Disneyland began running the park trains on B biodiesel . The program was discontinued in due to storage issues but in January it was announced that the park would then be running all trains on biodiesel manufactured from its own used cooking oils. This is a change from running the trains on soy based biodiesel. In the historic Mt. Washington Cog Railway added the first biodiesel locomotive to its all steam locomotive fleet. The fleet has climbed up the western slopes of Mount Washington in New Hampshire since with a peak vertical climb of . degrees. On July the then Indian Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda announced in Railway Budget that bio diesel will be used in Indian Railways Diesel Engines. A test flight has been performed by a Czech jet aircraft completely powered on biodiesel. Other recent jet flights using biofuel however have been using other types of renewable fuels. On November United Airlines flew the world s first commercial aviation flight on a microbially derived biofuel using Solajet Solazyme s algae derived renewable jet fuel. The Eco skies Boeing plane was fueled with percent Solajet and percent petroleum derived jet fuel. The commercial Eco skies flight departed from Houston s IAH airport at and landed at Chicago s ORD airport at . In September the Dutch flag carrier KLM contracted AltAir Fuels to supply all KLM flights departing Los Angeles International Airport with biofuel. For the next three years the Paramount California based company will pump biofuel directly to the airport from their nearby refinery. Biodiesel can also be used as a heating fuel in domestic and commercial boilers a mix of heating oil and biofuel which is standardized and taxed slightly differently from diesel fuel used for transportation. Bioheat fuel is a proprietary blend of biodiesel and traditional heating oil. Bioheat is a registered trademark of the National Biodiesel Board NBB and the National Oilheat Research Alliance NORA in the U.S. and Columbia Fuels in Canada. Heating biodiesel is available in various blends. ASTM recognizes blends of up to percent biodiesel as equivalent to pure petroleum heating oil. Blends of higher levels of up to biofuel are used by many consumers. Research is underway to determine whether such blends affect performance. Older furnaces may contain rubber parts that would be affected by biodiesel s solvent properties but can otherwise burn biodiesel without any conversion required. Care must be taken however given that varnishes left behind by petrodiesel will be released and can clog pipes fuel filtering and prompt filter replacement is required. Another approach is to start using biodiesel as a blend and decreasing the petroleum proportion over time can allow the varnishes to come off more gradually and be less likely to clog. Thanks to its strong solvent properties however the furnace is cleaned out and generally becomes more efficient. A technical research paper describes laboratory research and field trials project using pure biodiesel and biodiesel blends as a heating fuel in oil fired boilers. During the Biodiesel Expo in the UK Andrew J. Robertson presented his biodiesel heating oil research from his technical paper and suggested B biodiesel could reduce UK household CO emissions by . million tons per year. A law passed under Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick requires all home heating diesel in that state to be biofuel by July and biofuel by . New York City has passed a similar law. With of oil spill costs invested in shoreline cleanup there is a search for more efficient and cost effective methods to extract oil spills from the shorelines. Biodiesel has displayed its capacity to significantly dissolve crude oil depending on the source of the fatty acids. In a laboratory setting oiled sediments that simulated polluted shorelines were sprayed with a single coat of biodiesel and exposed to simulated tides. Biodiesel is an effective solvent to oil due to its methyl ester component which considerably lowers the viscosity of the crude oil. Additionally it has a higher buoyancy than crude oil which later aids in its removal. As a result of oil was removed from cobble and fine sand in coarse sand and in gravel. Once the oil is liberated from the shoreline the oil biodiesel mixture is manually removed from the water surface with skimmers. Any remaining mixture is easily broken down due to the high biodegradability of biodiesel and the increased surface area exposure of the mixture. In UC Riverside installed a megawatt backup power system that is entirely fueled by biodiesel. Backup diesel fueled generators allow companies to avoid damaging blackouts of critical operations at the expense of high pollution and emission rates. By using B these generators were able to essentially eliminate the byproducts that result in smog ozone and sulfur emissions. The use of these generators in residential areas around schools hospitals and the general public result in substantial reductions in poisonous carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Transesterification of a vegetable oil was conducted as early as by Patrick Duffy four decades before the first diesel engine became functional. Rudolf Diesel s prime model a single ft . m iron cylinder with a flywheel at its base ran on its own power for the first time in Augsburg Germany on August running on nothing but peanut oil. In remembrance of this event August has been declared International Biodiesel Day . It is often reported that Diesel designed his engine to run on peanut oil but this is not the case. Diesel stated in his published papers at the Paris Exhibition in Exposition Universelle there was shown by the Otto Company a small Diesel engine which at the request of the French government ran on arachide earth nut or pea nut oil see biodiesel and worked so smoothly that only a few people were aware of it. The engine was constructed for using mineral oil and was then worked on vegetable oil without any alterations being made. The French Government at the time thought of testing the applicability to power production of the Arachide or earth nut which grows in considerable quantities in their African colonies and can easily be cultivated there. Diesel himself later conducted related tests and appeared supportive of the idea. In a speech Diesel said the use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today but such oils may become in the course of time as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time. Despite the widespread use of petroleum derived diesel fuels interest in vegetable oils as fuels for internal combustion engines was reported in several countries during the s and s and later during World War II. Belgium France Italy the United Kingdom Portugal Germany Brazil Argentina Japan and China were reported to have tested and used vegetable oils as diesel fuels during this time. Some operational problems were reported due to the high viscosity of vegetable oils compared to petroleum diesel fuel which results in poor atomization of the fuel in the fuel spray and often leads to deposits and coking of the injectors combustion chamber and valves. Attempts to overcome these problems included heating of the vegetable oil blending it with petroleum derived diesel fuel or ethanol pyrolysis and cracking of the oils. On August G. Chavanne of the University of Brussels Belgium was granted a patent for a Procedure for the transformation of vegetable oils for their uses as fuels fr. Procd de Transformation d Huiles Vgtales en Vue de Leur Utilisation comme Carburants Belgian Patent . This patent described the alcoholysis often referred to as transesterification of vegetable oils using ethanol and mentions methanol in order to separate the fatty acids from the glycerol by replacing the glycerol with short linear alcohols. This appears to be the first account of the production of what is known as biodiesel today. This is similar copy to the patented methods used in the th century to make lamp oil and may be inspired by some old historical oil lamps in some places. More recently in Brazilian scientist Expedito Parente invented and submitted for patent the first industrial process for the production of biodiesel. This process is classified as biodiesel by international norms conferring a standardized identity and quality. No other proposed biofuel has been validated by the motor industry. As of Parente s company Tecbio is working with Boeing and NASA to certify bioquerosene bio kerosene another product produced and patented by the Brazilian scientist. Research into the use of transesterified sunflower oil and refining it to diesel fuel standards was initiated in South Africa in . By the process for producing fuel quality engine tested biodiesel was completed and published internationally. An Austrian company Gaskoks obtained the technology from the South African Agricultural Engineers the company erected the first biodiesel pilot plant in November and the first industrial scale plant in April with a capacity of tons of rapeseed per annum . Throughout the s plants were opened in many European countries including the Czech Republic Germany and Sweden. France launched local production of biodiesel fuel referred to as diester from rapeseed oil which is mixed into regular diesel fuel at a level of and into the diesel fuel used by some captive fleets e.g. public transportation at a level of . Renault Peugeot and other manufacturers have certified truck engines for use with up to that level of partial biodiesel experiments with biodiesel are underway. During the same period nations in other parts of the world also saw local production of biodiesel starting up by the Austrian Biofuels Institute had identified countries with commercial biodiesel projects. biodiesel is now available at many normal service stations across Europe. Biodiesel has promising lubricating properties and cetane ratings compared to low sulfur diesel fuels. Fuels with higher lubricity may increase the usable life of high pressure fuel injection equipment that relies on the fuel for its lubrication. Depending on the engine this might include high pressure injection pumps pump injectors also called unit injectors and fuel injectors. The calorific value of biodiesel is about . MJ kg. This is lower than regular Number petrodiesel. Variations in biodiesel energy density is more dependent on the feedstock used than the production process. Still these variations are less than for petrodiesel. It has been claimed biodiesel gives better lubricity and more complete combustion thus increasing the engine energy output and partially compensating for the higher energy density of petrodiesel. The color of biodiesel ranges from golden to dark brown depending on the production method. It is slightly miscible with water has a high boiling point and low vapor pressure. The flash point of biodiesel exceeds C F significantly higher than that of petroleum diesel which may be as low as C F . Biodiesel has a density of . g cm higher than petrodiesel . g cm . Biodiesel contains virtually no sulfur and it is often used as an additive to ultra low sulfur diesel ULSD fuel to aid with lubrication as the sulfur compounds in petrodiesel provide much of the lubricity. The power output of biodiesel depends on its blend quality and load conditions under which the fuel is burnt. The thermal efficiency for example of B as compared to B will vary due to the differing energy content of the various blends. Thermal efficiency of a fuel is based in part on fuel characteristics such as viscosity specific density and flash point these characteristics will change as the blends as well as the quality of biodiesel varies. The American Society for Testing and Materials has set standards in order to judge the quality of a given fuel sample. One study found that the brake thermal efficiency of B was superior to traditional petroleum counterpart at higher compression ratios this higher brake thermal efficiency was recorded at compression ratios of . It was noted that as the compression ratios increased the efficiency of all fuel types as well as blends being tested increased though it was found that a blend of B was the most economical at a compression ratio of over all other blends. The study implied that this increase in efficiency was due to fuel density viscosity and heating values of the fuels. Fuel systems on some modern diesel engines were not designed to accommodate biodiesel while many heavy duty engines are able to run with biodiesel blends up to B. Traditional direct injection fuel systems operate at roughly psi at the injector tip while the modern common rail fuel system operates upwards of PSI at the injector tip. Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range from below freezing to over F C . Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels as opposed to the common rail fuel system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out of specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as spray pattern and atomization are directly related to injection timing. One study found that during atomization biodiesel and its blends produced droplets greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional diesel fuel. It was found that droplets at the periphery of the spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center. This was attributed to the faster pressure drop at the edge of the spray pattern there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B had the greatest spray penetration this was attributed to the greater density of B. Having a greater droplet size can lead to inefficiencies in the combustion increased emissions and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater cetane rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission. Emissions are inherent to the combustion of diesel fuels that are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency E.P.A. . As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process in order to ensure E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust gas recirculation system E.G.R. and the diesel particulate filter D.P.F. are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions. A study performed by the Chonbuk National University concluded that a B biodiesel blend reduced carbon monoxide emissions by approximately and particulate matter emissions by roughly . NOx emissions however were found to increase without the application of an E.G.R. system. The study also concluded that with E.G.R a B biodiesel blend considerably reduced the emissions of the engine. Additionally analysis by the California Air Resources Board found that biodiesel had the lowest carbon emissions of the fuels tested those being ultra low sulfur diesel gasoline corn based ethanol compressed natural gas and five types of biodiesel from varying feedstocks. Their conclusions also showed great variance in carbon emissions of biodiesel based on the feedstock used. Of soy tallow canola corn and used cooking oil soy showed the highest carbon emissions while used cooking oil produced the lowest. While studying the effect of biodiesel on diesel particulate filters it was found that though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash as the diesel particulates are catalyzed they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. clarification needed This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system. As of blended biodiesel fuels especially B B and B are regularly used in many heavy duty vehicles especially transit buses in US cities. Characterization of exhaust emissions showed significant emission reductions compared to regular diesel. Biodiesel has a number of standards for its quality including European standard EN ASTM International D and others. When biodiesel is cooled below a certain point some of the molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than one quarter of the wavelengths of visible light this is the cloud point CP . As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point CFPP . As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure B biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed RME starts to gel at approximately C F . Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around C F and C F respectively. There are a number of commercially available additives that will significantly lower the pour point and cold filter plugging point of pure biodiesel. Winter operation is also possible by blending biodiesel with other fuel oils including low sulfur diesel fuel and diesel kerosene. Another approach to facilitate the use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second fuel tank for biodiesel in addition to the standard diesel fuel tank. The second fuel tank can be insulated and a heating coil using engine coolant is run through the tank. The fuel tanks can be switched over when the fuel is sufficiently warm. A similar method can be used to operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil. Biodiesel may contain small but problematic quantities of water. Although it is only slightly miscible with water it is hygroscopic. One of the reasons biodiesel can absorb water is the persistence of mono and diglycerides left over from an incomplete reaction. These molecules can act as an emulsifier allowing water to mix with the biodiesel. citation needed In addition there may be water that is residual to processing or resulting from storage tank condensation. The presence of water is a problem because Previously the amount of water contaminating biodiesel has been difficult to measure by taking samples since water and oil separate. However it is now possible to measure the water content using water in oil sensors. Water contamination is also a potential problem when using certain chemical catalysts involved in the production process substantially reducing catalytic efficiency of base high pH catalysts such as potassium hydroxide. However the super critical methanol production methodology whereby the transesterification process of oil feedstock and methanol is effectuated under high temperature and pressure has been shown to be largely unaffected by the presence of water contamination during the production phase. Global biodiesel production reached . million tons in . Approximately of biodiesel production came from the European Union. citation needed In in the United States average retail at the pump prices including federal and state fuel taxes of B B were lower than petroleum diesel by about cents and B blends were the same as petrodiesel. However as part of a dramatic shift in diesel pricing by July the US DOE was reporting average costs of B cents per gallon higher than petroleum diesel . gal vs. . gal . B and B generally cost more than petrodiesel except where local governments provide a tax incentive or subsidy. In the month of October Biodiesel B was cents lower gallon than petrodiesel. Biodiesel is commonly produced by the transesterification of the vegetable oil or animal fat feedstock and other non edible raw materials such as frying oil etc. There are several methods for carrying out this transesterification reaction including the common batch process heterogeneous catalysts supercritical processes ultrasonic methods and even microwave methods. Chemically transesterified biodiesel comprises a mix of mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The most common form uses methanol converted to sodium methoxide to produce methyl esters commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester FAME as it is the cheapest alcohol available though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester FAEE biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids FFAs in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process or they are esterified yielding more biodiesel using an acidic catalyst. After this processing unlike straight vegetable oil biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel and can replace it in most current uses. The methanol used in most biodiesel production processes is made using fossil fuel inputs. However there are sources of renewable methanol made using carbon dioxide or biomass as feedstock making their production processes free of fossil fuels. A by product of the transesterification process is the production of glycerol. For every tonne of biodiesel that is manufactured kg of glycerol are produced. Originally there was a valuable market for the glycerol which assisted the economics of the process as a whole. However with the increase in global biodiesel production the market price for this crude glycerol containing water and catalyst residues has crashed. Research is being conducted globally to use this glycerol as a chemical building block see chemical intermediate under Wikipedia article Glycerol . One initiative in the UK is The Glycerol Challenge. Usually this crude glycerol has to be purified typically by performing vacuum distillation. This is rather energy intensive. The refined glycerol purity can then be utilised directly or converted into other products. The following announcements were made in A joint venture of Ashland Inc. and Cargill announced plans to make propylene glycol in Europe from glycerol and Dow Chemical announced similar plans for North America. Dow also plans to build a plant in China to make epichlorhydrin from glycerol. Epichlorhydrin is a raw material for epoxy resins. In biodiesel production capacity was growing rapidly with an average annual growth rate from of over . For the year the latest for which actual production figures could be obtained total world biodiesel production was about million tonnes with . million tonnes processed in Europe of which . million tonnes was from Germany and most of the rest from the USA. In production in Europe alone had risen to . million tonnes. In July a duty was added to American imported biodiesel in the European Union in order to balance the competition from European especially German producers. The capacity for in Europe totalled million tonnes. This compares with a total demand for diesel in the US and Europe of approximately million tonnes billion gallons . Total world production of vegetable oil for all purposes in was about million tonnes with about million tonnes each of palm oil and soybean oil. As of Indonesia is the world s top supplier of palmoil based biofuel with annual production of . million tons and expected to export about million tonnes of biodiesel. US biodiesel production in brought the industry to a new milestone. Under the EPA Renewable Fuel Standard targets have been implemented for the biodiesel production plants in order to monitor and document production levels in comparison to total demand. According to the year end data released by the EPA biodiesel production in reached more than billion gallons. This production number far exceeded the million gallon target set by the EPA. The projected production for is nearly billion gallons. A variety of oils can be used to produce biodiesel. These include Many advocates suggest that waste vegetable oil is the best source of oil to produce biodiesel but since the available supply is drastically less than the amount of petroleum based fuel that is burned for transportation and home heating in the world this local solution could not scale to the current rate of consumption. Animal fats are a by product of meat production and cooking. Although it would not be efficient to raise animals or catch fish simply for their fat use of the by product adds value to the livestock industry hogs cattle poultry . Today multi feedstock biodiesel facilities are producing high quality animal fat based biodiesel. Currently a million dollar plant is being built in the US with the intent of producing . million litres million gallons biodiesel from some of the estimated billion kg . billion pounds of chicken fat produced annually at the local Tyson poultry plant. Similarly some small scale biodiesel factories use waste fish oil as feedstock. An EU funded project ENERFISH suggests that at a Vietnamese plant to produce biodiesel from catfish basa also known as pangasius an output of tons day of biodiesel can be produced from tons of fish waste in turn resulting from tons of fish . This project utilises the biodiesel to fuel a CHP unit in the fish processing plant mainly to power the fish freezing plant. Current worldwide production of vegetable oil and animal fat is not sufficient to replace liquid fossil fuel use. Furthermore some object to the vast amount of farming and the resulting fertilization pesticide use and land use conversion that would be needed to produce the additional vegetable oil. The estimated transportation diesel fuel and home heating oil used in the United States is about million tons billion pounds according to the Energy Information Administration US Department of Energy. In the United States estimated production of vegetable oil for all uses is about million tons billion pounds and estimated production of animal fat is . million tonnes billion pounds . If the entire arable land area of the USA million acres or . million square kilometers were devoted to biodiesel production from soy this would just about provide the million tonnes required assuming an optimistic US gal acre of biodiesel . This land area could in principle be reduced significantly using algae if the obstacles can be overcome. The US DOE estimates that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States it would require square miles square kilometers which is a few thousand square miles larger than Maryland or greater than the area of Belgium assuming a yield of tonnes hectare US gal acre . Given a more realistic yield of tonnes hectare US gal acre the area required is about square kilometers or roughly equal to that of the state of Georgia or of England and Wales. The advantages of algae are that it can be grown on non arable land such as deserts or in marine environments and the potential oil yields are much higher than from plants. Feedstock yield efficiency per unit area affects the feasibility of ramping up production to the huge industrial levels required to power a significant percentage of vehicles. Algae fuel yields have not yet been accurately determined but DOE is reported as saying that algae yield times more energy per acre than land crops such as soybeans. Yields of tonnes hectare are considered practical by Ami Ben Amotz of the Institute of Oceanography in Haifa who has been farming Algae commercially for over years. Jatropha has been cited as a high yield source of biodiesel but yields are highly dependent on climatic and soil conditions. The estimates at the low end put the yield at about US gal acre . tonnes per hectare per crop in more favorable climates two or more crops per year have been achieved. It is grown in the Philippines Mali and India is drought resistant and can share space with other cash crops such as coffee sugar fruits and vegetables. It is well suited to semi arid lands and can contribute to slow down desertification according to its advocates. According to a study by Drs. Van Dyne and Raymer for the Tennessee Valley Authority the average US farm consumes fuel at the rate of litres per hectare . US gal acre of land to produce one crop. However average crops of rapeseed produce oil at an average rate of L ha US gal acre and high yield rapeseed fields produce about L ha US gal acre . The ratio of input to output in these cases is roughly . and .. Photosynthesis is known to have an efficiency rate of about of total solar radiation and if the entire mass of a crop is utilized for energy production the overall efficiency of this chain is currently about While this may compare unfavorably to solar cells combined with an electric drive train biodiesel is less costly to deploy solar cells cost approximately US per square meter and transport electric vehicles require batteries which currently have a much lower energy density than liquid fuels . A study found that biodiesel production using soybeans required more fossil energy than the biodiesel produced and more energy using sunflowers. However these statistics by themselves are not enough to show whether such a change makes economic sense. Additional factors must be taken into account such as the fuel equivalent of the energy required for processing the yield of fuel from raw oil the return on cultivating food the effect biodiesel will have on food prices and the relative cost of biodiesel versus petrodiesel water pollution from farm run off soil depletion citation needed and the externalized costs of political and military interference in oil producing countries intended to control the price of petrodiesel. The debate over the energy balance of biodiesel is ongoing. Transitioning fully to biofuels could require immense tracts of land if traditional food crops are used although non food crops can be utilized . The problem would be especially severe for nations with large economies since energy consumption scales with economic output. If using only traditional food plants most such nations do not have sufficient arable land to produce biofuel for the nation s vehicles. Nations with smaller economies hence less energy consumption and more arable land may be in better situations although many regions cannot afford to divert land away from food production. For third world countries biodiesel sources that use marginal land could make more sense e.g. pongam oiltree nuts grown along roads or jatropha grown along rail lines. In tropical regions such as Malaysia and Indonesia plants that produce palm oil are being planted at a rapid pace to supply growing biodiesel demand in Europe and other markets. Scientists have shown that the removal of rainforest for palm plantations is not ecologically sound since the expansion of oil palm plantations poses a threat to natural rainforest and biodiversity. It has been estimated in Germany that palm oil biodiesel has less than one third of the production costs of rapeseed biodiesel. The direct source of the energy content of biodiesel is solar energy captured by plants during photosynthesis. Regarding the positive energy balance of biodiesel citation needed Multiple economic studies have been performed regarding the economic impact of biodiesel production. One study commissioned by the National Biodiesel Board reported the production of biodiesel supported more than jobs. The growth in biodiesel also helps significantly increase GDP. In biodiesel created more than billion in GDP. Judging by the continued growth in the Renewable Fuel Standard and the extension of the biodiesel tax incentive the number of jobs can increase to . billion in income and reaching billion in GDP by and . One of the main drivers for adoption of biodiesel is energy security. This means that a nation s dependence on oil is reduced and substituted with use of locally available sources such as coal gas or renewable sources. Thus a country can benefit from adoption of biofuels without a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. While the total energy balance is debated it is clear that the dependence on oil is reduced. One example is the energy used to manufacture fertilizers which could come from a variety of sources other than petroleum. The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL states that energy security is the number one driving force behind the US biofuels programme and a White House Energy Security for the st Century paper makes it clear that energy security is a major reason for promoting biodiesel. The former EU commission president Jose Manuel Barroso speaking at a recent EU biofuels conference stressed that properly managed biofuels have the potential to reinforce the EU s security of supply through diversification of energy sources. Many countries around the world are involved in the growing use and production of biofuels such as biodiesel as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels and oil. To foster the biofuel industry governments have implemented legislations and laws as incentives to reduce oil dependency and to increase the use of renewable energies. Many countries have their own independent policies regarding the taxation and rebate of biodiesel use import and production. It was required by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act Bill C that by the year gasoline contained renewable content and that by diesel and heating oil contained renewable content. The EcoENERGY for Biofuels Program subsidized the production of biodiesel among other biofuels via an incentive rate of CAN . per liter from to . A decrease of . will be applied every year following until the incentive rate reaches . in . Individual provinces also have specific legislative measures in regards to biofuel use and production. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit VEETC was the main source of financial support for biofuels but was scheduled to expire in . Through this act biodiesel production guaranteed a tax credit of US per gallon produced from virgin oils and . per gallon made from recycled oils. Currently soybean oil is being used to produce soybean biodiesel for many commercial purposes such as blending fuel for transportation sectors. The European Union is the greatest producer of biodiesel with France and Germany being the top producers. To increase the use of biodiesel there are policies requiring the blending of biodiesel into fuels including penalties if those rates are not reached. In France the goal was to reach integration but plans for that stopped in . As an incentive for the European Union countries to continue the production of the biofuel there are tax rebates for specific quotas of biofuel produced. In Germany the minimum percentage of biodiesel in transport diesel is set at so called B . The surge of interest in biodiesels has highlighted a number of environmental effects associated with its use. These potentially include reductions in greenhouse gas emissions deforestation pollution and the rate of biodegradation. According to the EPA s Renewable Fuel Standards Program Regulatory Impact Analysis released in February biodiesel from soy oil results on average in a reduction in greenhouse gases compared to petroleum diesel and biodiesel produced from waste grease results in an reduction. See chapter . of the EPA report for more detailed information. However environmental organizations for example Rainforest Rescue and Greenpeace criticize the cultivation of plants used for biodiesel production e.g. oil palms soybeans and sugar cane. They say the deforestation of rainforests exacerbates climate change and that sensitive ecosystems are destroyed to clear land for oil palm soybean and sugar cane plantations. Moreover that biofuels contribute to world hunger seeing as arable land is no longer used for growing foods. The Environmental Protection Agency EPA published data in January showing that biofuels made from palm oil will not count towards the nation s renewable fuels mandate as they are not climate friendly. Environmentalists welcome the conclusion because the growth of oil palm plantations has driven tropical deforestation for example in Indonesia and Malaysia. In some poor countries the rising price of vegetable oil is causing problems. Some propose that fuel only be made from non edible vegetable oils such as camelina jatropha or seashore mallow which can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow or would produce only low yields. Others argue that the problem is more fundamental. Farmers may switch from producing food crops to producing biofuel crops to make more money even if the new crops are not edible. The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise. It may take some time as farmers can take some time to change which things they are growing but increasing demand for first generation biofuels is likely to result in price increases for many kinds of food. Some have pointed out that there are poor farmers and poor countries who are making more money because of the higher price of vegetable oil. Biodiesel from sea algae would not necessarily displace terrestrial land currently used for food production and new algaculture jobs could be created. By comparison it should be mentioned that the production of biogas utilizes agricultural waste to generate a biofuel known as biogas and also produces compost thereby enhancing agriculture sustainability and food production. There is ongoing research into finding more suitable crops and improving oil yield. Other sources are possible including human fecal matter with Ghana building its first fecal sludge fed biodiesel plant. Using the current yields vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would require twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean production or two thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production to meet current US heating and transportation needs. citation needed Specially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields and are very useful in crop rotation with cereals and have the added benefit that the meal leftover after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide. The NFESC with Santa Barbara based Biodiesel Industries is working to develop biodiesel technologies for the US navy and military one of the largest diesel fuel users in the world. A group of Spanish developers working for a company called Ecofasa announced a new biofuel made from trash. The fuel is created from general urban waste which is treated by bacteria to produce fatty acids which can be used to make biodiesel. Another approach that does not require the use of chemical for the production involves the use of genetically modified microbes. From to the U.S. NREL experimented with using algae as a biodiesel source in the Aquatic Species Program . A self published article by Michael Briggs at the UNH Biodiesel Group offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all vehicular fuel with biodiesel by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than which Briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants. This oil rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biodiesel with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol. The production of algae to harvest oil for biodiesel has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield algaculture unlike crop based biofuels does not entail a decrease in food production since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water. Many companies are pursuing algae bio reactors for various purposes including scaling up biodiesel production to commercial levels. Prof. Rodrigo E. Teixeira from the University of Alabama in Huntsville demonstrated the extraction of biodiesel lipids from wet algae using a simple and economical reaction in ionic liquids. Millettia pinnata also known as the Pongam Oiltree or Pongamia is a leguminous oilseed bearing tree that has been identified as a candidate for non edible vegetable oil production. Pongamia plantations for biodiesel production have a two fold environmental benefit. The trees both store carbon and produce fuel oil. Pongamia grows on marginal land not fit for food crops and does not require nitrate fertilizers. The oil producing tree has the highest yield of oil producing plant approximately by weight of the seed is oil while growing in malnourished soils with high levels of salt. It is becoming a main focus in a number of biodiesel research organizations. The main advantages of Pongamia are a higher recovery and quality of oil than other crops and no direct competition with food crops. However growth on marginal land can lead to lower oil yields which could cause competition with food crops for better soil. Several groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha curcas a poisonous shrub like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biodiesel feedstock oil. Much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha through advancements in genetics soil science and horticultural practices. SG Biofuels a San Diego based Jatropha developer has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of Jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties. SG Biofuels also claims that additional benefits have arisen from such strains including improved flowering synchronicity higher resistance to pests and disease and increased cold weather tolerance. Plant Research International a department of the Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project JEP that examines the feasibility of large scale Jatropha cultivation through field and laboratory experiments. The Center for Sustainable Energy Farming CfSEF is a Los Angeles based non profit research organization dedicated to Jatropha research in the areas of plant science agronomy and horticulture. Successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase Jatropha farm production yields by in the next ten years. A group at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow published a paper in September stating that they had isolated large amounts of lipids from single celled fungi and turned it into biodiesel in an economically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species Cunninghamella japonica and others is likely to appear in the near future. The recent discovery of a variant of the fungus Gliocladium roseum points toward the production of so called myco diesel from cellulose. This organism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern Patagonia and has the unique capability of converting cellulose into medium length hydrocarbons typically found in diesel fuel. Researchers at the University of Nevada Reno have successfully produced biodiesel from oil derived from used coffee grounds. Their analysis of the used grounds showed a to oil content by weight . Once the oil was extracted it underwent conventional processing into biodiesel. It is estimated that finished biodiesel could be produced for about one US dollar per gallon. Further it was reported that the technique is not difficult and that there is so much coffee around that several hundred million gallons of biodiesel could potentially be made annually. However even if all the coffee grounds in the world were used to make fuel the amount produced would be less than percent of the diesel used in the United States annually. It won t solve the world s energy problem Dr. Misra said of his work. Recently alligator fat was identified as a source to produce biodiesel. Every year about million pounds of alligator fat are disposed of in landfills as a waste byproduct of the alligator meat and skin industry. Studies have shown that biodiesel produced from alligator fat is similar in composition to biodiesel created from soybeans and is cheaper to refine since it is primarily a waste product. A microreactor has been developed to convert biodiesel into hydrogen steam to power fuel cells. Steam reforming also known as fossil fuel reforming is a process which produces hydrogen gas from hydrocarbon fuels most notably biodiesel due to its efficiency. A microreactor or reformer is the processing device in which water vapour reacts with the liquid fuel under high temperature and pressure. Under temperatures ranging from C a nickel based catalyst enables the production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen Hydrocarbon HO CO H Highly endothermic Furthermore a higher yield of hydrogen gas can be harnessed by further oxidizing carbon monoxide to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide CO HO CO H Mildly exothermic Hydrogen fuel cells background information Fuel cells operate similar to a battery in that electricity is harnessed from chemical reactions. The difference in fuel cells when compared to batteries is their ability to be powered by the constant flow of hydrogen found in the atmosphere. Furthermore they produce only water as a by product and are virtually silent. The downside of hydrogen powered fuel cells is the high cost and dangers of storing highly combustible hydrogen under pressure. One way new processors can overcome the dangers of transporting hydrogen is to produce it as necessary. The microreactors can be joined to create a system that heats the hydrocarbon under high pressure to generate hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide a process called steam reforming. This produces up to gallons of hydrogen minute and gives the potential of powering hydrogen refueling stations or even an on board hydrogen fuel source for hydrogen cell vehicles. Implementation into cars would allow energy rich fuels such as biodiesel to be transferred to kinetic energy while avoiding combustion and pollutant byproducts. The hand sized square piece of metal contains microscopic channels with catalytic sites which continuously convert biodiesel and even its glycerol byproduct to hydrogen. Lubricity of fuel plays an important role in wear that occurs in an engine. A diesel engine relies on its fuel to provide lubricity for the metal components that are constantly in contact with each other. Biodiesel is a much better lubricant compared with petroleum diesel due to the presence of esters. Tests have shown that the addition of a small amount of biodiesel to diesel can significantly increase the lubricity of the fuel in short term. However over a longer period of time years studies show that biodiesel loses its lubricity. This could be because of enhanced corrosion over time due to oxidation of the unsaturated molecules or increased water content in biodiesel from moisture absorption. One of the main concerns regarding biodiesel is its viscosity. The viscosity of diesel is . . cSt at C and the viscosity of biodiesel made from soybean oil is between . and . cSt The viscosity of diesel must be high enough to provide sufficient lubrication for the engine parts but low enough to flow at operational temperature. High viscosity can plug the fuel filter and injection system in engines. Vegetable oil is composed of lipids with long chains of hydrocarbons to reduce its viscosity the lipids are broken down into smaller molecules of esters. This is done by converting vegetable oil and animal fats into alkyl esters using transesterification to reduce their viscosity Nevertheless biodiesel viscosity remains higher than that of diesel and the engine may not be able to use the fuel at low temperatures due to the slow flow through the fuel filter. Biodiesel has higher brake specific fuel consumption compared to diesel which means more biodiesel fuel consumption is required for the same torque. However B biodiesel blend has been found to provide maximum increase in thermal efficiency lowest brake specific energy consumption and lower harmful emissions. The engine performance depends on the properties of the fuel as well as on combustion injector pressure and many other factors. Since there are various blends of biodiesel that may account for the contradicting reports as regards engine performance.",FALSE

The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described on the web page of Global Footprint Network or in greater detail in academic papers including Borucke et al. The National Accounts Review Committee has also published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts. The first academic publication about ecological footprints was by William Rees in . The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of Mathis Wackernagel under Rees supervision at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver Canada from . Originally Wackernagel and Rees called the concept appropriated carrying capacity . To make the idea more accessible Rees came up with the term ecological footprint inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer s small footprint on the desk . In early Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint Reducing Human Impact on the Earth with illustrations by Phil Testemale. Footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for Carbon Food Housing and Goods and Services as well as the total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world s population at that level of consumption. This approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to life cycle analysis wherein the consumption of energy biomass food fiber building material water and other resources are converted into a normalized measure of land area called global hectares gha . The focus of Ecological Footprint accounting is biological resources. Rather than non renewable resources like oil or minerals it is the biological resources that are the materially most limiting resources for the human enterprise. For instance while the amount of fossil fuel still underground is limited even more limiting is the biosphere s ability to cope with the CO emitted when burning it. This ability is one of the competing uses of the planet s biocapacity. Similarly minerals are limited by the energy available to extract them from the lithosphere and concentrate them. The limits of ecosystems ability to renew biomass is given by factors such as water availability climate soil fertility solar energy technology and management practices. This capacity to renew driven by photosynthesis is called biocapacity. Per capita ecological footprint EF or ecological footprint analysis EFA is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles and checking this against biocapacity nature s ability to provide for this consumption. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more or less than is available within its territory or to what extent the nation s lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying capacity and overconsumption with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not sustainable. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty first century. In the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately . global hectares gha per capita. The U.S. footprint per capita was . gha and that of Switzerland was . gha while China s was . gha. The WWF claims that the human footprint has exceeded the biocapacity the available supply of natural resources of the planet by . Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the billion people on Earth at that time was about . hectares per person which is smaller than the . global hectares published for because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas. A number of NGOs offer ecological footprint calculators see Footprint Calculator below . According to the edition of the National Footprint Accounts humanity s total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since growing an average of . per year SD . . Humanity s ecological footprint was . billion gha in and increased to . billion gha in . The world average ecological footprint in was . global hectares per person. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about of humanity s total ecological footprint. The Earth s biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only . per year SD . . Because of agricultural intensification biocapacity was at . billion gha in and grew to . billion gha in . Therefore the Earth has been in ecological overshoot where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem can t renew since the s. In Earth Overshoot Day the date where humanity has used more from nature than the planet can renew in the entire year was estimated to be August . Now more than of humanity lives in countries that run an ecological deficit. This means their ecological footprint for consumption exceeds the biocapacity of that country. The UK s average ecological footprint is . global hectares per capita gha with variations between regions ranging from . gha Wales to . gha East England . Two recent studies citation needed have examined relatively low impact small communities. BedZED a home mixed income housing development in South London was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the Peabody Trust. Despite being populated by relatively mainstream home buyers BedZED was found to have a footprint of . gha due to on site renewable energy production energy efficient architecture and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on site London s first carsharing club. The report did not measure the added footprint of the visitors who have toured BedZED since its completion in . Findhorn Ecovillage a rural intentional community in Moray Scotland had a total footprint of . gha including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of Cluny Hill College. However the residents alone have a footprint of . gha a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world. Keveral Farm an organic farming community in Cornwall was found to have a footprint of . gha though with substantial differences in footprints among community members. In a study of consumers acting green vs. brown where green people are expected to have significantly lower ecological impact than brown consumers the conclusion was the research found no significant difference between the carbon footprints of green and brown consumers . A study concluded the same. A study published in Environmental Research Letters posited that the most significant way individuals could reduce their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children followed by living without a vehicle forgoing air travel and adopting a plant based diet. The World Scientists Warning to Humanity A Second Notice co signed by over scientists around the globe urges human beings to re examine and change our individual behaviors including limiting our own reproduction ideally to replacement level at most and drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of fossil fuels meat and other resources. According to a study published in Science avoiding animal products altogether including meat and dairy is the most significant way individuals can reduce their overall ecological impact on earth meaning not just greenhouse gases but global acidification eutrophication land use and water use . Early criticism was published by van den Bergh and Verbruggen in which was updated in . Another criticism was published in . A more complete review commissioned by the Directorate General for the Environment European Commission was published in June . The review found Ecological Footprint a useful indicator for assessing progress on the EU s Resource Strategy the authors noted that Ecological Footprint analysis was unique in its ability to relate resource use to the concept of carrying capacity. The review noted that further improvements in data quality methodologies and assumptions were needed. A recent critique of the concept is due to Blomqvist et al. a with a reply from Rees and Wackernagel and a rejoinder by Blomqvist et al. b. An additional strand of critique is due to Giampietro and Saltelli a with a reply from Goldfinger et al. a rejoinder by Giampietro and Saltelli a and additional comments from van den Bergh and Grazi . A number of countries have engaged in research collaborations to test the validity of the method. This includes Switzerland Germany United Arab Emirates and Belgium. Grazi et al. have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental externalities agglomeration effects and trade advantages. They find that the two methods can lead to very distinct and even opposite rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity. However this should not be surprising since the two methods address different research questions. Newman has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti urban bias as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth. Calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population e.g. New York and Singapore respectively may lead to the perception of these populations as parasitic . This is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity and instead must rely upon large hinterlands. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of economies of scale. Furthermore such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for autarky. Some even take this train of thought a step further claiming that the Footprint denies the benefits of trade. Therefore the critics argue that the Footprint can only be applied globally. The method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high productivity agricultural monocultures by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly if organic farming yields were lower than those of conventional methods this could result in the former being penalized with a larger ecological footprint. Of course this insight while valid stems from the idea of using the footprint as one s only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators such as one for biodiversity the problem might be solved. Indeed WWF s Living Planet Report complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity. Manfred Lenzen and Shauna Murray have created a modified Ecological Footprint that takes biodiversity into account for use in Australia. Although the ecological footprint model prior to treated nuclear power in the same manner as coal power the actual real world effects of the two are radically different. A life cycle analysis centered on the Swedish Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant estimated carbon dioxide emissions at . g kW h and . g kW h in for the Torness Nuclear Power Station. This compares to g kW h for hydroelectric power g kW h for installed coal g kW h for oil and g kW h for natural gas generation in the United States in . Figures released by Mark Hertsgaard however show that because of the delays in building nuclear plants and the costs involved investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies have seven times the return on investment of investments in nuclear energy. The Swedish utility Vattenfall did a study of full life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources the utility uses to produce electricity namely Nuclear Hydro Coal Gas Solar Cell Peat and Wind. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced . grams of carbon dioxide per kW h of produced power. This compares to for natural gas and for coal according to this study . The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO of any of their electricity sources. Claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste. A article from the BBC states The World Health Organization WHO says million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions and . million indoors through using solid fuel. In the U.S. alone fossil fuel waste kills people each year. A coal power plant releases times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage. It is estimated that during US coal burning released times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the Three Mile Island incident. In addition fossil fuel waste causes global warming which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes flooding and other weather events. The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production. In their comparison deaths per TW yr of electricity produced in UK and USA from to are quoted as for hydropower for coal for natural gas and for nuclear. The Western Australian government State of the Environment Report included an Ecological Footprint measure for the average Western Australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in a total of about hectares. The world average ecological footprint in was . global hectares per person. The average per country ranges from over to under global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities. The GHG footprint or the more narrow carbon footprint are a component of the ecological footprint. Often when only the carbon footprint is reported it is expressed in weight of CO or COe representing GHG warming potential GGWP but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products people or whole societies. . . . the average world citizen has an eco footprint of about . global average hectares while there are only . global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of natural capital Related concepts Since the s a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene has been proposed to distinguish the period of major human impact.",FALSE
"94",94,"ecology","/wiki/Ecology",TRUE,0,"branch|study|action|","Ecology from Greek house or environment study of A is the branch of biology which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment","Ecology from Greek house or environment study of A is the branch of biology which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment. Objects of study include interactions of organisms that include biotic and abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest include the biodiversity distribution biomass and populations of organisms as well as cooperation and competition within and between species. Ecosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms the communities they make up and the non living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes such as primary production pedogenesis nutrient cycling and niche construction regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits. Biodiversity means the varieties of species genes and ecosystems enhances certain ecosystem services. Ecology is not synonymous with environmentalism natural history or environmental science. It overlaps with the closely related sciences of evolutionary biology genetics and ethology. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain Ecology has practical applications in conservation biology wetland management natural resource management agroecology agriculture forestry agroforestry fisheries city planning urban ecology community health economics basic and applied science and human social interaction human ecology . For example the Circles of Sustainability approach treats ecology as more than the environment out there . It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms including humans and resources compose ecosystems which in turn maintain biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living biotic and non living abiotic components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life supporting functions and produce natural capital like biomass production food fuel fiber and medicine the regulation of climate global biogeochemical cycles water filtration soil formation erosion control flood protection and many other natural features of scientific historical economic or intrinsic value. The word ecology kologie was coined in by the German scientist Ernst Haeckel. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy particularly from ethics and politics. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on natural history. Modern ecology became a much more rigorous science in the late th century. Evolutionary concepts relating to adaptation and natural selection became the cornerstones of modern ecological theory. The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro level e.g. cells to a planetary scale e.g. biosphere phenomena. Ecosystems for example contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms i.e. individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities . Ecosystems are dynamic they do not always follow a linear successional path but they are always changing sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem s area can vary greatly from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids in turn support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles however do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame. The main subdisciplines of ecology population or community ecology and ecosystem ecology exhibit a difference not only of scale but also of two contrasting paradigms in the field. The former focus on organisms distribution and abundance while the later focus on materials and energy fluxes. O Neill et al. The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system such as aphids migrating on a single tree while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences such as atmosphere or climate. Hence ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units such as vegetation associations climate and soil types and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional landscape and chronological scales. To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework the biological world is organized into a nested hierarchy ranging in scale from genes to cells to tissues to organs to organisms to species to populations to communities to ecosystems to biomes and up to the level of the biosphere. This framework forms a panarchy and exhibits non linear behaviors this means that effect and cause are disproportionate so that small changes to critical variables such as the number of nitrogen fixers can lead to disproportionate perhaps irreversible changes in the system properties. Noss Carpenter Biodiversity an abbreviation of biological diversity describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations and there are many ways to index measure characterize and represent its complex organization. Biodiversity includes species diversity ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels. Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. Natural capital that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration e.g. riverine fish runs and avian insect control has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced. An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications for species and ecosystem level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to consulting firms governments and industry. The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result. More specifically habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable that is any component or characteristic of the environment related directly e.g. forage biomass and quality or indirectly e.g. elevation to the use of a location by the animal. For example a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example one population of a species of tropical lizard Tropidurus hispidus has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. Biotope and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably but the former applies to a community s environment whereas the latter applies to a species environment. Definitions of the niche date back to but G. Evelyn Hutchinson made conceptual advances in by introducing a widely adopted definition the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes. The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub divided into the fundamental and the realized niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists. The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a Euclidean hyperspace whose dimensions are defined as environmental variables and whose size is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has positive fitness. Biogeographical patterns and range distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property phenotype or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource one will always out compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies however suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species. Organisms are subject to environmental pressures but they also modify their habitats. The regulatory feedback between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local e.g. a beaver pond to global scales over time and even after death such as decaying logs or silica skeleton deposits from marine organisms. The process and concept of ecosystem engineering is related to niche construction but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify maintain and create habitats. The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term niche construction is more often used in reference to the under appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche. An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of social insects including ants bees wasps and termites. There is an emergent homeostasis or homeorhesis in the structure of the nest that regulates maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds for example maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover a nest can survive over successive generations so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time. Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth s ecosystems mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate precipitation weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest temperate broadleaf and mixed forest temperate deciduous forest taiga tundra hot desert and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe the human body is a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet s oceans. The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy nutrients and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere s CO and O composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale for example the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self regulating range of tolerance. Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment. A population consists of individuals of the same species that live interact and migrate through the same niche and habitat. A primary law of population ecology is the Malthusian growth model which states a population will grow or decline exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant. Simplified population models usually start with four variables death birth immigration and emigration. An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population such as on an island where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that random processes create the observed data. In these island models the rate of population change is described by where N is the total number of individuals in the population b and d are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively and r is the per capita rate of population change. Using these modelling techniques Malthus population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the logistic equation where N is the number of individuals measured as biomass density a is the maximum per capita rate of change and K is the carrying capacity of the population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size dN dT is equal to growth aN that is limited by carrying capacity N K . Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include life history fecundity and survivorship and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as matrix algebra. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas. In cases where basic models are insufficient ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods such as the Akaike information criterion or use models that can become mathematically complex as several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data. The concept of metapopulations was defined in as a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize . Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in conservation research. Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement because it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat. Migration is also a population level phenomenon as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement such as commuting foraging territorial behaviour stasis and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration because it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population. In metapopulation terminology migrating individuals are classed as emigrants when they leave a region or immigrants when they enter a region and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality i.e. sinks are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure. Johnson Stinchcomb Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator prey dynamics competition among similar plant species or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals. Tansley Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials e.g. carbon phosphorus between different pools e.g. tree biomass soil organic material . Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure primary production g C m in a wetland in relation to decomposition and consumption rates g C m y . This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants i.e. primary producers and the decomposers e.g. fungi and bacteria The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to in the published work of George Perkins Marsh Man and Nature . Within an ecosystem organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self organizing patterns across different scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial freshwater atmospheric or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity. A food web is the archetypal ecological network. Plants capture solar energy and use it to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows. Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat such as a cave or a pond and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms which can be difficult to decipher or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems. Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships some species have many weak feeding links e.g. omnivores while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links e.g. primary predators . Theoretical and empirical studies identify non random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated. A trophic level from Greek troph troph meaning food or feeding is a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level according to ecological pyramids nearer the abiotic source. Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or trophism among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators and the horizontal dimension represents the abundance or biomass at each level. When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level they naturally sort into a pyramid of numbers . Species are broadly categorized as autotrophs or primary producers heterotrophs or consumers and Detritivores or decomposers . Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food production is greater than respiration by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy respiration exceeds production . Heterotrophs can be further sub divided into different functional groups including primary consumers strict herbivores secondary consumers carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores and tertiary consumers predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators . Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators because compared to herbivores they are relatively inefficient at grazing. Trophic levels are part of the holistic or complex systems view of ecosystems. Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions giving a macroscopic view of the system. While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top down control within food webs it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete homogeneous trophic levels is fiction. Nonetheless recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist but above the herbivore trophic level food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores. A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics other food web connections and can cause the extinction of other species. Sea otters Enhydra lutris are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species because they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters for example is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller s sea cow Hydrodamalis gigas . While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied. Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This biocomplexity stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other such as transitional areas or ecotones spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one. Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena otherwise captured in the expression coined by Aristotle the sum is greater than the parts . E Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types spatial temporal structural process behavioral and geometric. From these principles ecologists have identified emergent and self organizing phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence ranging from molecular to planetary and these require different explanations at each integrative level. Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady states directed by random fluctuations of history. Long term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales. These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network LTER . The longest experiment in existence is the Park Grass Experiment which was initiated in . Another example is the Hubbard Brook study which has been in operation since . Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the biological organization of life that self organizes into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system such as an ecosystem cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts. New properties emerge because the components interact not because the basic nature of the components is changed. Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system which leads to a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells. Ecology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. Natural selection life history development adaptation populations and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological behavioural and genetic traits for example can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize classify and investigate life through common systematic principals such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes and evolution can be rapid occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation. All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour including memory and communication. Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism s behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants mobile phytoplankton zooplankton swimming toward the female egg the cultivation of fungi by weevils the mating dance of a salamander or social gatherings of amoeba. Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology. Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness. Predator prey interactions are an introductory concept into food web studies as well as behavioural ecology. Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators such as avoid flee or defend. Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history such as growth feeding mating socializing or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation optimization or efficiency. For example t he threat sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk or t he optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized which depends on the prey s initial fitness benefits obtainable by not fleeing energetic escape costs and expected fitness loss due to predation risk. Elaborate sexual displays and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals. The birds of paradise for example sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors. Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from evolutionary ecology and neurobiology primarily cognitive science in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework. Until recently however cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings. With consideration of the selection pressure on cognition cognitive ecology can contribute intellectual coherence to the multidisciplinary study of cognition. As a study involving the coupling or interactions between organism and environment cognitive ecology is closely related to enactivism a field based upon the view that ...we must see the organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification and selection... . Social ecological behaviours are notable in the social insects slime moulds social spiders human society and naked mole rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects including ants bees and wasps are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make up as every other male in the colony. In contrast group selectionists find examples of altruism among non genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group whereby it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members survive better than groups with predominantly selfish members. Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately of all plants for example have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients. Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism because many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host e.g. via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules denying the services of a beneficial partner their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and thus becomes difficult to forecast. Co evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis for example posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure. Biogeography an amalgamation of biology and geography is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in . Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example the theory of island biogeography published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory. Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth s biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming. A population ecology concept is r K selection theory D one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain life history evolution. The premise behind the r K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example when an island is first colonized density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density independent forces of natural selection which is called r selection. As the population becomes more crowded it approaches the island s carrying capacity thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions the population experiences density dependent forces of natural selection called K selection. In the r K selection model the first variable r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r selected species is one that has high birth rates low levels of parental investment and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r selected characteristics. In contrast a K selected species has low rates of fecundity high levels of parental investment in the young and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K selected characteristics including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring. The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction PCR . The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in . Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book Molecular Markers Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint such as bacteria fungi and nematodes. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context the marriage between genetics ecology and evolution resulted in a new sub discipline called phylogeography. Rachel Carson Silent Spring Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science. Human ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species. Human ecology may be defined from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment and as a human being somehow different from animal life in general interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three. The term was formally introduced in but many sociologists geographers psychologists and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior especially in the late th century. The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems there has been a surge of interest in social natural capital which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce regulate maintain and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health cognitive and physiological economies and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth. Grumbine Ecology is an employed science of restoration repairing disturbed sites through human intervention in natural resource management and in environmental impact assessments. Edward O. Wilson predicted in that the st century will be the era of restoration in ecology . Ecological science has boomed in the industrial investment of restoring ecosystems and their processes in abandoned sites after disturbance. Natural resource managers in forestry for example employ ecologists to develop adapt and implement ecosystem based methods into the planning operation and restoration phases of land use. Ecological science is used in the methods of sustainable harvesting disease and fire outbreak management in fisheries stock management for integrating land use with protected areas and communities and conservation in complex geo political landscapes. The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked and contains resources for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle. Like ecology the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature. Environment includes the physical world the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation. The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation including abiotic factors such as temperature radiation light chemistry climate and geology. The biotic environment includes genes cells organisms members of the same species conspecifics and other species that share a habitat. The distinction between external and internal environments however is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of thermodynamics for example apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes however they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole or holocoenotic system as it was once called. This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole or umwelt . Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem. Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community such as a fire flood drought or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates species assemblages and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as a kind of regenerative insurance. Ernest et al. The Earth was formed approximately . billion years ago. As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of carbon dioxide nitrogen and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth s surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and in turn the atmosphere also evolved. Throughout history the Earth s atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles have been in a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms likely anaerobic methanogen microbes started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane H CO CH HO . Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds for example HS CO hv CHO HO S . Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen dominant atmosphere the Great Oxidation did not begin until approximately . . billion years ago but photosynthetic processes started . to billion years prior. The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates activity behaviour and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms for example have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy. There is a relationship between light primary production and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet s ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life and also acts as a catalyst for genetic mutation. Plants algae and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of HS are autotrophs. Autotrophs responsible for primary production assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds. Cronk Fennessy Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded they quickly lose oxygen becoming hypoxic an environment with O concentration below mg liter and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive compete and diversify in these environments. For example their roots and stems contain large air spaces aerenchyma that regulate the efficient transportation of gases for example CO and O used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants halophytes have additional specialized adaptations such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt NaCl concentrations to live in estuarine brackish or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate manganese ions ferric ions sulfate carbon dioxide and some organic compounds other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide for example is reduced to methane CH by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth gravitropism orientation cues for animal migrations and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms e.g. height size shape their behaviour e.g. diving running flying and the habitat occupied e.g. water hot deserts cold tundra . Climatic and osmotic pressure places physiological constraints on organisms especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by osmotic pressure gradients. Water pressure in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example diving animals such as whales dolphins and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations. Turbulent forces in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution form and dynamics. On a planetary scale ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat nutrient and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones affecting how fish algae and other parts of the aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. clarification needed This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity as species adapted to wetter conditions are range restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems e.g. of the Columbia Basin in western North America to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems. Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere. By approximately million years ago the end of the Devonian period photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above which allowed combustion to occur. Fire releases CO and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression. While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time Charles Cooper brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the s. Native North Americans were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants for example are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species e.g. Pinus halepensis cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems. Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter for example leaves on the forest floor results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet s soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth s biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves for example create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots fungi bacteria worms ants beetles centipedes spiders mammals birds reptiles amphibians and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological trophism in soils. Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated flow and recycled through the environment. This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet including minerals soil pH ions water and atmospheric gases. Six major elements hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen sulfur and phosphorus H C N O S and P form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth s geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry. The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth s oceans hold gigatonnes Gt of carbon that vegetation and soil hold Gt and that fossil fuel emissions are . Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth s history regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example through the early mid Eocene volcanic outgassing the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO carbon dioxide concentrations to levels as high as ppm. In the Oligocene from twenty five to thirty two million years ago there was another significant restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis C photosynthesis and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO concentrations below ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human driven modifications to the planet s ecosystems e.g. disturbance biodiversity loss agriculture contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather alter species distributions and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers melting mountain ice caps and rising sea levels. Consequently species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane CH emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle because methane is a greenhouse gas that is times more effective at absorbing long wave radiation than CO on a year time scale. Hence there is a relationship between global warming decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles. Ernst Haeckel B Ecology has a complex origin due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle were among the first to record observations on natural history. However they viewed life in terms of essentialism where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an idealized type. This contrasts against the modern understanding of ecological theory where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of natural selection. Early conceptions of ecology such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to Herodotus died c. BC who described one of the earliest accounts of mutualism in his observation of natural dentistry . Basking Nile crocodiles he noted would open their mouths to give sandpipers safe access to pluck leeches out giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile. Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology. He and his student Theophrastus made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations biogeography physiology and on their behaviour giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche. Stephen Forbes  Ecological concepts such as food chains population regulation and productivity were first developed in the s through the published works of microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek and botanist Richard Bradley . Biogeographer Alexander von Humboldt was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients where species are replaced or altered in form along environmental gradients such as a cline forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from Isaac Newton as he developed a form of terrestrial physics . In Newtonian fashion he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species to area relationships. Natural historians such as Humboldt James Hutton and Jean Baptiste Lamarck among others laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences. The term ecology German Oekologie kologie was coined by Ernst Haeckel in his book Generelle Morphologie der Organismen . Haeckel was a zoologist artist writer and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy. Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory. Some mark Haeckel s definition as the beginning others say it was Eugenius Warming with the writing of Oecology of Plants An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities or Carl Linnaeus principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early th century. Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature. His works influenced Charles Darwin who adopted Linnaeus phrase on the economy or polity of nature in The Origin of Species. Linnaeus was the first to frame the balance of nature as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel who admired Darwin s work defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous. From Aristotle until Darwin the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms their adaptations and the environment. An exception is the publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution he was one of the founders of soil ecology and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences. Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the th century around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest . The scientist Ellen Swallow Richards may have first introduced the term oekology which eventually morphed into home economics in the U.S. as early . In the early th century ecology transitioned from a more descriptive form of natural history to a more analytical form of scientific natural history. Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book in presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the s. Clements superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of seral development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations. The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an idealistic form of holism. The term holism was coined in by Jan Christiaan Smuts a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements superorganism concept. C Around the same time Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book Animal Ecology. Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains food cycles and food size and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton s food cycle was replaced by food web in a subsequent ecological text. Alfred J. Lotka brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology. In Raymond Lindeman wrote a landmark paper on the trophic dynamics of ecology which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. Robert MacArthur advanced mathematical theory predictions and tests in ecology in the s which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists. Ecology also has developed through contributions from other nations including Russia s Vladimir Vernadsky and his founding of the biosphere concept in the s and Japan s Kinji Imanishi and his concepts of harmony in nature and habitat segregation in the s. Scientific recognition of contributions to ecology from non English speaking cultures is hampered by language and translation barriers. Rachel Carson Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology environmental management and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by notable ecologists in the history of conservation biology such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley have been seen as far removed from urban centres where it is claimed the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early s who fought for urban health ecology then called euthenics and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop among others were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the s. In marine biologist and ecologist Rachel Carson s book Silent Spring helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic pesticides such as DDT bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then ecologists have worked to bridge their understanding of the degradation of the planet s ecosystems with environmental politics law restoration and natural resources management.  ",FALSE

The ethical ramifications if life extension becomes a possibility are debated by bioethicists. The sale of purported anti aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about billion of revenue a year in . The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe. During the process of aging an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules cells tissues and organs. Specifically aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by genomic instability telomere attrition epigenetic alterations loss of proteostasis deregulated nutrient sensing mitochondrial dysfunction cellular senescence stem cell exhaustion and altered intercellular communication. Oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well. The longest documented human lifespan is years the case of Jeanne Calment who according to records was born in and died in whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse commonly used as a model in research on aging is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair antioxidant defenses energy metabolism proteostasis maintenance and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy. The average lifespan in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life vulnerability to accidents and age related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care vaccinations good diet exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking. Maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes fruit flies and mice include caloric restriction gene manipulation and administration of pharmaceuticals. Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality. Some animals such as hydra planarian flatworms and certain sponges corals and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality. Much life extension research focuses on nutrition diets or supplements although there is little evidence that they have an effect. The many diets promoted by anti aging advocates are often contradictory. original research In some studies calorie restriction has been shown to extend the life of mice yeast and rhesus monkeys. However a more recent study did not find calorie restriction to improve survival in rhesus monkeys. In humans the long term health effects of moderate caloric restriction with sufficient nutrients are unknown. The free radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life. However evidence suggest that carotene supplements and high doses of vitamin E increase mortality rates. Resveratrol is a sirtuin stimulant that has been shown to extend life in animal models but the effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans is unclear as of . The anti aging industry offers several hormone therapies. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example the American Medical Association has been critical of some anti aging hormone therapies. While growth hormone GH decreases with age the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or IGF modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative. The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and the Egyptian Smith medical papyrus all the way through the Taoists Ayurveda practitioners alchemists hygienists such as Luigi Cornaro Johann Cohausen and Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland and philosophers such as Francis Bacon Ren Descartes Benjamin Franklin and Nicolas Condorcet. However the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the th beginning of the th century to the so called fin de sicle end of the century period denoted as an end of an epoch and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism entailing the pursuit of life extension or life extensionism . Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist Elie Metchnikoff the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris and Charles douard Brown Squard the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology. Sociologist James Hughes claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the Age of Enlightenment. He cites Francis Bacon as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life noting Bacon s novel New Atlantis wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. Robert Boyle founding member of the Royal Society also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension according to Hughes and proposed such experiments as to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young . Biologist Alexis Carrel was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells says Hughes. Regulatory and legal struggles between the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In Saul Kent and Bill Faloon the principals of the Foundation were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a Holocaust and seeking gestapo like power through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims. In Doubleday published The Immortal Cell One Scientist s Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging by Michael D. West. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension. Other modern life extensionists include writer Gennady Stolyarov who insists that death is the enemy of us all to be fought with medicine science and technology transhumanist philosopher Zoltan Istvan who proposes that the transhumanist must safeguard one s own existence above all else futurist George Dvorsky who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved and recording artist Steve Aoki who has been called one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension . In the American Academy of Anti Aging Medicine AM was formed. The American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes neither anti aging medicine nor the AM s professional standing. In Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel formed the Methuselah Foundation which gives financial grants to anti aging research projects. In de Grey and several others founded the SENS Research Foundation a California based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti aging research projects at various universities. In Google announced Calico a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging. It is led by Arthur D. Levinson and its research team includes scientists such as Hal V. Barron David Botstein and Cynthia Kenyon. In biologist Craig Venter founded Human Longevity Inc. a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype microbiome and phenotype database. Aside from private initiatives aging research is being conducted in university laboratories and includes universities such as Harvard and UCLA. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging. Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example Leonard Hayflick who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around cell divisions reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti aging supplements. Research by Sobh and Martin suggests that people buy anti aging products to obtain a hoped for self e.g. keeping a youthful skin or to avoid a feared self e.g. looking old . The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped for self it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared self. Though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces staying for and against life extension. By in Russia the United States Israel and the Netherlands the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step life without aging and with radical life extension and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people. Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti aging research. This includes Larry Ellison founder of Oracle Peter Thiel former PayPal CEO Larry Page co founder of Google and Peter Diamandis. Leon Kass chairman of the US President s Council on Bioethics from to has questioned whether potential exacerbation of overpopulation problems would make life extension unethical. He states his opposition to life extension with the words simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... The desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one s life and keep it it is also an expression of a childish and narcissistic wish incompatible with devotion to posterity. John Harris former editor in chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics argues that as long as life is worth living according to the person himself we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them. Transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few. In an extended metaphor entitled The Fable of the Dragon Tyrant Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur. Controversy about life extension is due to fear of overpopulation and possible effects on society. Biogerontologist Aubrey De Grey counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate menopause allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus decreasing the yearly population growth rate. Moreover the philosopher and futurist Max More argues that given the fact the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation. A Spring Pew Research poll in the United States found that of Americans would want life extension treatments and would reject it. However it also found that believed most people would want it and that only consider an ideal lifespan to be more than years. The median ideal lifespan was years of age and the majority of the public viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. of Americans believed that radical life extension RLE would be good for society while said they believed it would be bad for society. One possibility for why of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy. Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated though some variation exists between religious denominations. Mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. David Sinclair says I don t see aging as a disease but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body . The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not. However not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody director of academic affairs for AARP notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context. David Gems assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing argues that aging should be viewed as a disease. In response to the universality of aging David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that Basenji are not dogs because they do not bark. Because of the universality of aging he calls it a special sort of disease . Robert M. Perlman coined the terms aging syndrome and disease complex in to describe aging. The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America it would also increase the regulation of the anti aging market by the FDA. Anti aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs. Theoretically extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by periodic replacement of damaged tissues molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues reversal of harmful epigenetic changes or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity. Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by fold the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction. A review of longevity research noted Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction or from mutations studied previously yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm s lifespan and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover the very notion of a life extension factor that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology. There are a number of chemicals intended to slow the aging process currently being studied in animal models. One type of research is related to the observed effects of a calorie restriction CR diet which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals. Based on that research there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a caloric restriction diet which are known as Caloric restriction mimetic drugs. Some drugs that are already approved for other uses have been studied for possible longevity effects on laboratory animals because of a possible CR mimic effect they include rapamycin metformin and other geroprotectors. MitoQ resveratrol and pterostilbene are dietary supplements that have also been studied in this context. Other attempts to create anti aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction of research has been research into the possibility of using the enzyme telomerase in order to counter the process of telomere shortening. However there are potential dangers in this since some research has also linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler one of the founders of nanotechnology postulated cell repair machines including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular computers in his book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil a futurist and transhumanist stated in his book The Singularity Is Near that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by . According to Richard Feynman it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him circa the idea of a medical use for Feynman s theoretical nanomachines see biological machine . Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would in theory be possible to as Feynman put it swallow the doctor . The idea was incorporated into Feynman s essay There s Plenty of Room at the Bottom. Some life extensionists suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells body parts or even entire bodies generally referred to as reproductive cloning that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures such as mammalian joints and limbs have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of the implantation of bio engineered bladders grown from patients own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life extension technologies. The use of human stem cells particularly embryonic stem cells is controversial. Opponents objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations. citation needed Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy. The controversies over cloning are similar except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to reproductive cloning. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies lacking consciousness for eventual brain transplantation. Replacement of biological susceptible to diseases organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the Initiative. Cryonics is the low temperature freezing usually at C or . F or . K of a human corpse with the hope that resuscitation may be possible in the future. It is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community and has been characterized as quackery. Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of stem cells and tissue engineering telomere lengthening machinery allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins targeted ablation of cells immunotherapeutic clearance and novel lysosomal hydrolases. While many biogerontologists find these ideas worthy of discussion and SENS conferences feature important research in the field some contend that the alleged benefits are too speculative given the current state of technology referring to it as fantasy rather than science . Genome editing in which nucleic acid polymers are delivered as a drug and are either expressed as proteins interfere with the expression of proteins or correct genetic mutations has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging. A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast nematode worms fruit flies and mice. As of the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly in mice and fold in nematode worms. In The Selfish Gene Richard Dawkins describes an approach to life extension that involves fooling genes into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably these genes are activated by environmental factors and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore to extend life we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on and we should be able to do so by identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body . One hypothetical future strategy that as some suggest who eliminates the complications related to a physical body involves the copying or transferring e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that when run on appropriate hardware it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain. Whether or not an exact copy of one s mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate. Some scientists believe that the dead may one day be resurrected through simulation technology. Some clinics currently offer injection of blood products from young donors. The alleged benefits of the treatment none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study include a longer life darker hair better memory better sleep curing heart diseases diabetes and Alzheimer. The approach is based on parabiosis studies such as Irina Conboy do on mice but Conboy says young blood does not reverse aging even in mice and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research. Neuroscientist Tony Wyss Coray who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as said people offering those treatments are basically abusing people s trust and that young blood treatments are the scientific equivalent of fake news . The treatment appeared in HBO s Silicon Valley fiction series. Two clinics in California run by Jesse Karmazin and David C. Wright offer injections of plasma extracted from the blood of young people. Karmazin has not published in any peer reviewed journal and his current study does not use a control group.",FALSE

Waste sorting can occur manually at the household and collected through curbside collection schemes or automatically separated in materials recovery facilities or mechanical biological treatment systems. Hand sorting was the first method used in the history of waste sorting. Waste can also be sorted in a civic amenity site. Waste segregation means dividing waste into dry and wet. Dry waste includes wood and related products metals and glass. Wet waste typically refers to organic waste usually generated by eating establishments and are heavy in weight due to dampness.

These human controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific cultures or sociometabolic regimes. Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as the self reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes distribution processes and flows which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society in use stocks and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society. Social metabolic processes begin with the human appropriation of materials and energy from nature. These can be transformed and circulated to be consumed and excreted finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different environmental impact depending on how it is performed the amount of materials and energy involved in the process the area where it occurs the time available or the Nature s regenerative capacity. Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms oil refineries and power stations factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In use stocks which comprise buildings vehicles appliances infrastructure etc. are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter transportation or communication. Society and its metabolism together form an autopoietic system a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter which is delivered by social metabolism and the latter needs humans to operate it. Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation see material flow analysis. In material flow accounting for example the inputs and outputs of materials and energy of a particular state or region as well as imports and exports are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about commercial transactions. Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex self reproducing system and it can therefore be seen as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self reproduction. A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ...

"99",99,"upcycling","/wiki/Upcycling",TRUE,0,"material|material|process|waste|product|","Upcycling also known as creative reuse is the process of transforming by products waste materials useless or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality and environmental value","Upcycling also known as creative reuse is the process of transforming by products waste materials useless or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality and environmental value. Upcycling is the opposite of downcycling which is the other face of the recycling process. Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality. Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material. The term downcycling was first used in print in an article in SalvoNEWS by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in . .mw parser output .templatequote overflow hidden margin em padding px .mw parser output .templatequote .templatequotecite line height .em text align left padding left .em margin top We talked about the impending EU Demolition Waste Streams directive. Recycling he said I call it downcycling. They smash bricks they smash everything. What we need is upcycling where old products are given more value not less. He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg while just down the road a load of similar block was scrapped. In the road outside his premises was the result of the Germans demolition waste recycling. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick old tiles and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe Upsizing was the title of the German edition of a book about upcycling first published in English in by Gunter Pauli and given the revised title of Upcycling in . The German edition was adapted to the German language and culture by Johannes F. Hartkemeyer then Director of the Volkshochschule in Osnabrck. The concept was later incorporated by William McDonough and Michael Braungart in their book Cradle to Cradle Remaking the Way We Make Things. They state that the goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage air pollution water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions. This is a significant step towards regenerative design culture where the end products are cleaner healthier and usually have a better value than the material inputs. For example during the recycling process of plastics other than those used to create bottles many different types of plastics are mixed resulting in a hybrid. This hybrid is used in the manufacturing of plastic lumber applications. However unlike the engineered polymer ABS which hold properties of several plastics well recycled plastics suffer phase separation that causes structural weakness in the final product. In Belinda Smith from Reuters wrote that upcycling had increased in the rich countries but observed that upcycling was a necessity in poorer ones Supporters of the environmentally friendly practice of upcycling say people in developing countries have effectively been upcycling for years using old packaging and clothing in new ways although more out of need than for the environment. But upcycling is now taking off in other countries reflecting an increased interest in eco friendly products particularly ones that are priced at an affordable level and proving profitable for the manufacturers. If upcycling is going to become mainstream then the corporate world needs to see that it can be profitable said Albe Zakes spokesman of U.S. company TerraCycle which specializes in finding new uses for discarded packaging. A growing number of companies are focusing on upcycling although the trend is still in its infancy with industry wide figures yet to be produced. Upcycling has shown significant growth across the United States. For example the number of products on Etsy or Pinterest tagged with the word upcycled increased from about in January to nearly a year later an increase of . As of April update that number stood at an additional increase of . Material downcycling occurs when it is not economic to restore materials to their original quality for example when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower grade casting alloys. Material upcycling in the thermodynamic sense is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality. Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product and How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources In some cases little energy is required to reuse a discarded product for example secondhand clothing. In other cases the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material. In the last case upcycling may be considered worst for environmental emissions strategies if energy comes from fossil fuels. The tradition of reusing found objects objet trouv in mainstream art came of age sporadically through the th century although it has long been a means of production in folk art. The Amish quilt for example came about through reapplication of salvaged fabric. Simon Rodia s Watts Towers in Los Angeles exemplifies upcycling of scrap metal pottery and broken glass on a grand scale it consists of structures the tallest reaching over meters into the Watts skyline. Intellectually upcycling bears some resemblance to the ready made art of Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists. Duchamp s Bicycle Wheel a front wheel and fork attached to a common stool is among the earliest of these works while Fountain a common urinal purchased at a hardware store is arguably his best known work. Pablo Picasso s Bull s Head a sculpture made from a discarded bicycle saddle and handlebars is the Spanish painter s sly nod to the Dadaists. Throughout the mid century the artist Joseph Cornell fabricated collages and boxed assemblage works from old books found objects and ephemera. Robert Rauschenberg collected trash and disused objects first in Morocco and later on the streets of New York to incorporate into his art works. The idea of consciously raising the inherent value of recycled objects as a political statement however rather than presenting recycled objects as a reflection or outcome from the means of production is largely a late th century concept. Romuald Hazoum an artist from the West African Bnin was heralded in for his use of discarded plastic gasoline and fuel canisters to resemble traditional African masks at Documenta in Kassel Germany. Hazoum has said of these works I send back to the West that which belongs to them that is to say the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day. Jeff Wassmann an American artist who has lived in Australia for the past years uses items found on beaches and junk stores in his travels to create the early Modern works of a fictional German relative Johann Dieter Wassmann . In Vorwarts Go Forward pictured Wassmann uses four simple objects to depict a vision of modern man on the precarious eave of the th century an early optometry chart as background a clock spring as eye a th century Chinese bone opium spoon from the Australian gold fields as nose and an upper set of dentures found on an Australian beach as mouth. Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work rather they are presented as gifts by not allowing these works to re enter the consumer cycle he averts the commodification of his end product. Max Zorn is a Dutch tape artist who creates artwork from ordinary brown packaging tape and hangs pieces on street lamps as a new form of street art at night. By adding and subtracting layers of tape on acrylic glass with a surgical scalpel the artwork can only be visible when light is placed behind it mimicking the effects similar to stained glass window methods. His technique with pioneering upcycling with street art has been featured at Frei Cycle the first design fair for recycling and upcycling in Freiburg Germany. A prominent example is the Recycled Orchestra of Cateura in Paraguay created in by the program Sounds of the Earth directed by Luis Szaran. The instruments of the orchestra are made from materials taken from the landfill of Asuncin whose name comes from the Cateura lagoon in the area. A limited part of its real history is narrated in the film Landfill Harmonic according to the version of Favio Chavez ex coordinator of Sounds of the Earth . In May an original member of the orchestra and two members of the parents association who helped build the current building of the Cateura music school filed a complaint with the Office of the Prosecutor against the director s administration for alleged lack of transparency . The complaint is backed by three senators from Paraguay . Many industrial processes like plastic and electronic fabrication rely on the consumption of finite resources. Furthermore the waste may have an environmental impact and can affect human health. Within this context upcycling describes the use of available and future technologies to reduce waste and resource consumption by creating a product with a higher value from waste or byproduct streams. INDUSTRIAL UPCYCLING is a new complex methodology for waste prevention. In late on logistics conference LOGISTICS RIDE Ostrava Czech Republic it was named for the first time INDUSTRY .. It consists of tools and methods streamlining the production surplus from one process or factory to the next one. The originator of the complex methodology is Michael Rada who started successful implementation within Czech republic industrial environment and expand to other locations. In consumer electronics the process of re manufacturing or refurbishment of second hand products can be seen as upcycling because of the reduced energy and material consumption in contrast to new manufacturing. The re manufactured product has a higher value than disposing or downcycling it. The use of Brewer s spent grain a waste product of brewing processes as a substrate in biogas processes eliminates the need for disposal and can generate significant profit to the overall brewing process. Depending on the substrate s price a profit of approximately of the operational costs is possible. In this process the biogas plant acts as an upcycler . As libraries are becoming more than just bricks mortar and their collections modern librarians are increasing their programming efforts. Upcycle programs or classes clubs are becoming more and more popular especially with the help of Pinterest. The Titusville Public Library has an upcycle class that started out by making roses. An organization called ScrapDC led Upcycle classes at the District of Columbia Public Library more specifically their Southeast Neighborhood Library. One of their more popular projects was turning old books into boxes. The Jerry Falwell Library at Liberty University holds an annual Creative Upcycling Contest for their students. The first contest had submissions of Art Made from Books . These submissions were three dimensional upcycles. Designers have begun to use both industrial textile waste and existing clothing as the base material for creating new fashions. Upcycling has been known to use either pre consumer or post consumer waste or possibly a combination of the two. Pre consumer waste is made while in the factory such as fabric remnants left over from cutting out patterns. post consumer waste refers to the finished product when it s no longer useful to the owner such as donated clothes . Often people practice linear economy where they are content to buy use then throw away. This system contributes to millions of kilos of textile waste being thrown away and makes fashion is the second most polluting industry after oil . while most textiles produced are recyclable around end up in land lls in the USA alone . Fast fashion companies are huge contributors to these problems as their whole purpose is to mass produce cheap clothing. To live a sustainable life clothing options opposite to the throw away attitude encouraged by fast fashion are needed. Upcycling can help with this as it puts into practice a more circular economy model. A Circular Economy is where resources are used for as long as possible getting the most value out of them while in use then restored and repurposed when their use is over. Popularized by McDonough and Braungart this has also been known as the cradle to cradle principle. This principle states a product should be designed either to have multiple life cycles or be biodegradable . Not only does upcycling help environmentally there are also economic benefits. By reusing materials that others may not find as desirable there are huge savings that can be made on buying supplies for business or personal use. At schools or university upcycling for art craft and design can be an easy and cheap way to prototype or finish a student project. There can also be an economic benefit with the final product. By definition upcycling means increasing value to the original product and this can be done by changing adding a personal spin to the design or improving material quality or fixing broken clothes. Billions of pounds of food are wasted every year around the world but there are good ways that people reuse food and find a way to upcycle. A way that is used very often is to feed it to animals because a lot of animals such as a pig will eat all the scraps given. Food waste can be donated and restaurants can save all the food customers don t eat. Donations can also be made by contacting local agricultural extension offices to find out where to donate food waste and telling them how often and how much you can donate. Another form of upcycling food would be to break it down and use it as energy. Engineers have found a way to break the food down into a reusable bio fuel by pressure cooking it and then they are able to make methane out of the remains which can be used to produce a lot of electricity and heat. When the food isn t used in those ways another way is to just break it down and use it in compost which will improve the soil. Pretty much any type of food waste such as fruits vegetables egg shells nuts and nut shells can be used in compost to make it richer soil. Tonnes of wastes are produced every day in our cities and some educators are attempting to raise citizens awareness especially the youth. To redefine the concept of recycling previously confined to trash categorization groups of young designers have attempted to transform trash into potentially marketable products such as backpacks made of waste plastic bags and area rugs created by reusing hides . One relevant book published by Community Museum Project in Hong Kong in was the first experiment on upcycling systems design. Spanning across material collecting upcycling design local production and public dissemination it provides proposals towards a sustainable system that will cast impact on our strategies of waste handling and energy saving. Hong Kong local inventor Gary Chan is actively involved in designing and making upcycling bikes by making use of waste materials as parts for his bikes. He invented at least bikes using wastes as a majority of the materials. Gary and his partners at Wheel Thing Makers regularly collect useful wastes such as leather skin from sofas hardwood plates of wardrobes or rubber tires from vehicle repair stores in the waste collection station on streets. Similar concepts evolve allover the world to tackle issue of rising excess of waste through creation of circular economies within the communities. The worldwide plastic production was million tons in and production levels are growing every year. Its haphazard disposal causes severe environmental damage such as the creation of the Great Pacific garbage patch. In order to solve this problem the employment of modern technologies and processes to reuse the waste plastic as a cheap substrate is under research. The goal is to bring this material from the waste stream back into the mainstream by developing processes which will create an economic demand for them. One approach in the field involves the conversion of waste plastics like LDPE PET and HDPE into paramagnetic conducting microspheres or into carbon nanomaterials by applying high temperatures and chemical vapor deposition. On a molecular level the treatment of polymers like polypropylene or thermoplastics with electron beams doses around kGy can increase material properties like bending strength and elasticity and provides an eco friendly and sustainable way to upcycle them. Active research is being carried out for the biotransformation upcycling of plastic waste e.g. polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane into PHA bioplastic using bacteria. PET could be converted into the biodegradable PHA by using a combination of temperature and microbial treatment. First it gets pyrolized at C and the resulting terephthalic acid is used as a substrate for microorganisms which convert it finally into PHA. Similar to the aforementioned approach is the combination of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes with powdered orange peel as a composite material. This might be used to remove synthetic dyes from wastewater. Biotechnology companies have recently shifted focus towards the conversion of agricultural waste or biomass to different chemicals or commodities. One company in particular BioTork has signed an agreement with the State of Hawaii and the USDA to convert the unmarketable papayas in Hawaii into fish feed. As part of this Zero Waste Initiative put forth by the State of Hawaii BioTork will upcycle the otherwise wasted biomass into a high quality omega rich fish feed.",FALSE

Reuse may include irrigation of gardens and agricultural fields or replenishing surface water and groundwater i.e. groundwater recharge . Reused water may also be directed toward fulfilling certain needs in residences e.g. toilet flushing businesses and industry and could even be treated to reach drinking water standards. This last option is called either direct potable reuse or indirect potable reuse depending on the approach used. Colloquially the term toilet to tap also refers to potable reuse. Reclaiming water for reuse applications instead of using freshwater supplies can be a water saving measure. When used water is eventually discharged back into natural water sources it can still have benefits to ecosystems improving streamflow nourishing plant life and recharging aquifers as part of the natural water cycle. Wastewater reuse is a long established practice used for irrigation especially in arid countries. Reusing wastewater as part of sustainable water management allows water to remain as an alternative water source for human activities. This can reduce scarcity and alleviate pressures on groundwater and other natural water bodies. Achieving more sustainable sanitation and wastewater management will require emphasis on actions linked to resource management such as wastewater reuse or excreta reuse that will keep valuable resources available for productive uses. This in turn supports human wellbeing and broader sustainability. Simply stated reclaimed water is water that is used more than one time before it passes back into the natural water cycle. Advances in wastewater treatment technology allow communities to reuse water for many different purposes. The water is treated differently depending upon the source and use of the water and how it gets delivered. Cycled repeatedly through the planetary hydrosphere all water on Earth is recycled water but the terms recycled water or reclaimed water typically mean wastewater sent from a home or business through a sewer system to a wastewater treatment plant where it is treated to a level consistent with its intended use. The World Health Organization has recognized the following principal driving forces for wastewater reuse Water recycling and reuse is of increasing importance not only in arid regions but also in cities and contaminated environments. Already the groundwater aquifers that are used by over half of the world population are being over drafted. Reuse will continue to increase as the world s population becomes increasingly urbanized and concentrated near coastlines where local freshwater supplies are limited or are available only with large capital expenditure. Large quantities of freshwater can be saved by wastewater reuse and recycling reducing environmental pollution and improving carbon footprint. Reuse can be an alternative water supply option. Most of the uses of water reclamation are non potable uses such as washing cars flushing toilets cooling water for power plants concrete mixing artificial lakes irrigation for golf courses and public parks and for hydraulic fracturing. Where applicable systems run a dual piping system to keep the recycled water separate from the potable water. The main reclaimed water applications in the world are shown below De facto unacknowledged or unplanned potable reuse refers to a situation where reuse of treated wastewater is in fact practiced but is not officially recognized. For example a wastewater treatment plant from one city may be discharging effluents to a river which is used as a drinking water supply for another city downstream. Unplanned Indirect Potable Use has existed for a long time. Large towns on the River Thames upstream of London Oxford Reading Swindon Bracknell discharge their treated sewage non potable water into the Thames which supplies water to London downstream. In the United States the Mississippi River serves as both the destination of sewage treatment plant effluent and the source of potable water. There are benefits of using recycled water for irrigation including the lower cost compared to some other sources and consistency of supply regardless of season climatic conditions and associated water restrictions. When reclaimed water is used for irrigation in agriculture the nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus content of the treated wastewater has the benefit of acting as a fertilizer. This can make the reuse of excreta contained in sewage attractive. The irrigation water can be used in different ways on different crops In developing countries agriculture is increasingly using untreated wastewater for irrigation often in an unsafe manner. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce so are attractive to farmers. However because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water resources with industry and municipal users there is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste directly to water their crops. There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated wastewater in agriculture. Wastewater from cities can contain a mixture of chemical and biological pollutants. In low income countries there are often high levels of pathogens from excreta. In emerging nations where industrial development is outpacing environmental regulation there are increasing risks from inorganic and organic chemicals. The World Health Organization in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO and the United Nations Environmental Program UNEP has developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in . These guidelines advocate a multiple barrier approach wastewater use for example by encouraging farmers to adopt various risk reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure. The use of reclaimed water to create enhance sustain or augment water bodies including wetlands aquatic habitats or stream flow is called environmental reuse . For example constructed wetlands fed by wastewater provide both wastewater treatment and habitats for flora and fauna. The use of reclaimed water to recharge aquifers that are not used as a potable water source. Planned potable reuse is publicly acknowledged as an intentional project to recycle water for drinking water. There are two ways in which potable water can be delivered for reuse Indirect Potable Reuse IPR and Direct Potable Reuse . Both these forms of reuse are described below and commonly involve a more formal public process and public consultation program than is the case with de facto or unacknowledged reuse. In indirect potable reuse applications the reclaimed wastewater is used directly or mixed with other sources. Direct potable reuse is also called toilet to tap . citation needed Some water agencies reuse highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater or resource recovery plants as a reliable drought proof source of drinking water. By using advanced purification processes they produce water that meets all applicable drinking water standards. System reliability and frequent monitoring and testing are imperative to them meeting stringent controls. The water needs of a community water sources public health regulations costs and the types of water infrastructure in place such as distribution systems man made reservoirs or natural groundwater basins determine if and how reclaimed water can be part of the drinking water supply. Some communities reuse water to replenish groundwater basins. Others put it into surface water reservoirs. In these instances the reclaimed water is blended with other water supplies and or sits in storage for a certain amount of time before it is drawn out and gets treated again at a water treatment or distribution system. In some communities the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system. Modern technologies such as reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply. Indirect potable reuse IPR means the water is delivered to the consumer indirectly. After it is purified the reused water blends with other supplies and or sits a while in some sort of storage man made or natural before it gets delivered to a pipeline that leads to a water treatment plant or distribution system. That storage could be a groundwater basin or a surface water reservoir. Some municipalities are using and others are investigating Indirect Potable Reuse IPR of reclaimed water. For example reclaimed water may be pumped into subsurface recharge or percolated down to surface recharge groundwater aquifers pumped out treated again and finally used as drinking water. This technique may also be referred to as groundwater recharging. This includes slow processes of further multiple purification steps via the layers of earth sand absorption and microflora in the soil biodegradation . IPR or even unplanned potable use of reclaimed wastewater is used in many countries where the latter is discharged into groundwater to hold back saline intrusion in coastal aquifers. IPR has generally included some type of environmental buffer but conditions in certain areas have created an urgent need for more direct alternatives. Direct potable reuse means the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system. Direct potable reuse may occur with or without engineered storage such as underground or above ground tanks. In a Direct Potable Reuse DPR scheme water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system. Direct potable reuse may occur with or without engineered storage such as underground or above ground tanks. In other words DPR is the introduction of reclaimed water derived from urban wastewater after extensive treatment and monitoring to assure that strict water quality requirements are met at all times directly into a municipal water supply system. IPR occurs through the augmentation of drinking water supplies with urban wastewater treated to a level suitable for IPR followed by an environmental buffer e.g. rivers dams aquifers etc. that precedes drinking water treatment. In this case urban wastewater passes through a series of treatment steps that encompasses membrane filtration and separation processes e.g. MF UF and RO followed by an advanced chemical oxidation process e.g. UV UV HO ozone . Wastewater reclamation can be especially important in relation to human spaceflight. In NASA announced it had built a human waste reclamation bioreactor designed for use in the International Space Station and a manned Mars mission. Human urine and feces are input into one end of the reactor and pure oxygen pure water and compost humanure are output from the other end. The soil could be used for growing vegetables and the bioreactor also produces electricity. Aboard the International Space Station astronauts have been able to drink recycled urine due to the introduction of the ECLSS system. The system costs million and has been working since May . The system recycles wastewater and urine back into potable water used for drinking food preparation and oxygen generation. This cuts back on the need for resupplying the space station so often. Water wastewater reuse as an alternative water source can provide significant economic social and environmental benefits which are key motivators for implementing such reuse programmes. Specifically in agriculture irrigation with wastewater may contribute to improve production yields reduce the ecological footprint and promote socioeconomic benefits. These benefits include Nonpotable reclaimed water is often distributed with a dual piping network that keeps reclaimed water pipes completely separate from potable water pipes. In many cities using reclaimed water it is now in such demand that consumers are only allowed to use it on assigned days. Some cities that previously offered unlimited reclaimed water at a flat rate are now beginning to charge citizens by the amount they use. citation needed For many types of reuse applications wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps before it can be used. Steps might include screening primary settling biological treatment tertiary treatment for example reverse osmosis and disinfection. There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe meaning free from bacteria and viruses. The following are some of the typical technologies Ozonation ultrafiltration aerobic treatment membrane bioreactor forward osmosis reverse osmosis advanced oxidation. Wastewater is generally treated to only secondary level treatment when used for irrigation. A pump station distributes reclaimed water to users around the city. This may include golf courses agricultural uses cooling towers or in land fills. Rather than treating wastewater for reuse purposes other options can achieve similar effects of freshwater savings The cost of reclaimed water exceeds that of potable water in many regions of the world where a fresh water supply is plentiful. However reclaimed water is usually sold to citizens at a cheaper rate to encourage its use. As fresh water supplies become limited from distribution costs increased population demands or climate change reducing sources the cost ratios will evolve also. The evaluation of reclaimed water needs to consider the entire water supply system as it may bring important value of flexibility into the overall system Reclaimed water systems usually require a dual piping network often with additional storage tanks which adds to the costs of the system. Reclaimed water is considered safe when appropriately used. Reclaimed water planned for use in recharging aquifers or augmenting surface water receives adequate and reliable treatment before mixing with naturally occurring water and undergoing natural restoration processes. Some of this water eventually becomes part of drinking water supplies. A water quality study published in compared the water quality differences of reclaimed recycled water surface water and groundwater. Results indicate that reclaimed water surface water and groundwater are more similar than dissimilar with regard to constituents. The researchers tested for representative constituents typically found in water. When detected most constituents were in the parts per billion and parts per trillion range. DEET a bug repellant and caffeine were found in all water types and virtually in all samples. Triclosan in anti bacterial soap toothpaste was found in all water types but detected in higher levels parts per trillion in reclaimed water than in surface or groundwater. Very few hormones steroids were detected in samples and when detected were at very low levels. Haloacetic acids a disinfection by product were found in all types of samples even groundwater. The largest difference between reclaimed water and the other waters appears to be that reclaimed water has been disinfected and thus has disinfection by products due to chlorine use . A study titled Irrigation of Parks Playgrounds and Schoolyards with Reclaimed Water found that there had been no incidences of illness or disease from either microbial pathogens or chemicals and the risks of using reclaimed water for irrigation are not measurably different from irrigation using potable water. A study conducted by the National Research Council in the United States of America found that the risk of exposure to certain microbial and chemical contaminants from drinking reclaimed water does not appear to be any higher than the risk experienced in at least some current drinking water treatment systems and may be orders of magnitude lower. This report recommends adjustments to the federal regulatory framework that could enhance public health protection for both planned and unplanned or de facto reuse and increase public confidence in water reuse. Many humans associate a feeling of disgust with reclaimed water and of a survey group said they would not even sip it. Nonetheless the main health risk for potable use of reclaimed water is the potential for pharmaceutical and other household chemicals or their derivatives Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants to persist in this water. This would be less of a concern if human excreta was kept out of sewage by using dry toilets or systems that treat blackwater separately from greywater. To address these concerns about the source water reclaimed water providers use multi barrier treatment processes and constant monitoring to ensure that reclaimed water is safe and treated properly for the intended end use. There is debate about possible health and environmental effects. To address these concerns A Risk Assessment Study of potential health risks of recycled water and comparisons to conventional Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Product PPCP exposures was conducted by the WateReuse Research Foundation. For each of four scenarios in which people come into contact with recycled water used for irrigation children on the playground golfers and landscape and agricultural workers the findings from the study indicate that it could take anywhere from a few years to millions of years of exposure to nonpotable recycled water to reach the same exposure to PPCPs that we get in a single day through routine activities. Using reclaimed water for non potable uses saves potable water for drinking since less potable water will be used for non potable uses. It sometimes contains higher levels of nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and oxygen which may somewhat help fertilize garden and agricultural plants when used for irrigation. The usage of water reclamation decreases the pollution sent to sensitive environments. It can also enhance wetlands which benefits the wildlife depending on that eco system. It also helps to stop the chances of drought as recycling of water reduces the use of fresh water supply from underground sources. For instance The San Jose Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant instituted a water recycling program to protect the San Francisco Bay area s natural salt water marshes. The main potential risks that are associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes when the treatment is not adequate are the following Wastewater reuse planned or unplanned is an ancient practice which has been applied since the dawn of human history and is closely connected to the development of sanitation provision. In the U.S. the Clean Water Act of mandated elimination of the discharge of untreated waste from municipal and industrial sources to make water safe for fishing and recreation. The US federal government provided billions of dollars in grants for building sewage treatment plants around the country. Modern treatment plants usually using oxidation and or chlorination in addition to primary and secondary treatment were required to meet certain standards. Los Angeles County s sanitation districts started providing treated wastewater for landscape irrigation in parks and golf courses in . The first reclaimed water facility in California was built at San Francisco s Golden Gate Park in . The Water Replenishment District of Southern California was the first groundwater agency to obtain permitted use of recycled water for groundwater recharge in . Orange County is located in Southern California USA and houses a classic example in indirect potable reuse. A large scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area providing a much needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater. Part of the injected water consists of recycled water starting as of with Water Factory which used RO and high lime to clean the water production capacity of m per day . This plant was decommissioned in and has since made place for a new project with a higher capacity m per day with an ultimate capacity of m per day under the name of Groundwater Replenishment System. The health and environmental safety conditions under which wastewater may be reused are not specifically regulated at the European Union EU level. There are no guidelines or regulations at EU level on water quality for water reuse purposes. In the Water Framework Directive reuse of water is mentioned as one of the possible measures to achieve the Directive s quality goals however this remains a relatively vague recommendation rather than a requirement Part B of Annex VI refers to reuse as one of the supplementary measures which Member States within each river basin district may choose to adopt as part of the programme of measures required under Article . Besides that Article of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive concerning the reuse of treated wastewater states that treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate is not specific enough to promote water reuse and it leaves too much room for interpretation as to what can be considered as an appropriate situation to reuse treated wastewater. Despite the lack of common water reuse criteria at the EU level several Member States MS have issued their own legislative frameworks regulations or guidelines for different water reuse applications e.g. Cyprus France Greece Italy and Spain . However after an evaluation carried out by the European Commission EC on the water reuse standards of several member states it was concluded that they differ in their approach. There are important divergences among the different standards regarding the permitted uses the parameters to be monitored and the limit values allowed. This lack of harmonization among water reuse standards might create some trade barriers for agricultural goods irrigated with reclaimed water. Once on the common market the level of safety in the producing member states may be not considered as sufficient by the importing countries. The most representative standards on wastewater reuse from European member states are the following Reclaimed water is not regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA but the EPA has developed water reuse guidelines that were most recently updated in . The EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse represents the international standard for best practices in water reuse. The document was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA the U.S. Agency for International Development USAID and the global consultancy CDM Smith. The Guidelines provide a framework for states to develop regulations that incorporate the best practices and address local requirements. When there are droughts in Australia interest in reclaimed effluent options increases. Brisbane has been seen as a leader in this trend and other cities and towns will review the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project once completed. While there are currently no full scale direct potable reuse schemes operating in Australia the Australian Antarctic Division is investigating the option of installing a potable reuse scheme at its Davis research base in Antarctica. To enhance the quality of the marine discharge from the Davis WWTP a number of different proven technologies have been selected to be used in the future such as ozonation UV disinfection chlorine as well as UF activated carbon filtration and RO. As of Israel leads the world in the proportion of water it recycles. Israel treats of its sewage billion liters a year and of the sewage from the Tel Aviv metropolitan area is treated and reused as irrigation water for agriculture and public works. As of today all the reclaimed sewage water in Israel is used for agricultural and land improvement purposes. An example of direct potable reuse is the case of Windhoek Namibia New Goreangab Water Reclamation Plant NGWRP where treated wastewater has been blended with drinking water for more than years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept i.e. pre ozonation enhanced coagulation dissolved air flotation rapid sand filtration and subsequent ozone biological activated carbon granular activated carbon ultrafiltration UF chlorination to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality. The reclaimed wastewater nowadays represent about of the city s drinking water production. In Singapore reclaimed water is called NEWater and is bottled directly from an advanced water purification facility for educational and celebratory purposes. Though most of the reused water is used for high tech industry in Singapore a small amount is returned to reservoirs for drinking water. At the end of the programme successfully branded as NEWater had garnered a percent acceptance rate with of respondents indicating that they would drink the reused water directly another only when mixed with reservoir water. The produced NEWater after stabilization addition of alkaline chemicals is in compliance with the WHO requirements and can be piped off to its wide range of applications e.g. reuse in industry discharge to a drinking water reservoir . NEWater now makes up around of Singapore s total use by Singapore s National Water Agency plans to triple the current NEWater capacity as to meet of Singapore s future water demand. In South Africa the main driver for wastewater reuse is drought conditions. For example in Beaufort West South Africa s a direct wastewater reclamation plant WRP for the production of drinking water was constructed in the end of as a result of acute water scarcity production of m per day . The process configuration based on multi barrier concept and includes the following treatment processes sand filtration UF two stage RO and permeate disinfected by ultraviolet light UV . The leaders in use of reclaimed water in the U.S. are Florida and California. In a January U.S. National Research Council report a committee of independent experts found that expanding the reuse of municipal wastewater for irrigation industrial uses and drinking water augmentation could significantly increase the United States total available water resources. One example is Orange County which is located in Southern California USA and houses a classic example in indirect potable reuse. A large scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area providing a much needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater.",FALSE
"101",101,"adaptive reuse","/wiki/Adaptive_reuse",TRUE,0,"process|","Adaptive reuse refers to the process of reusing an existing building for a purpose other than which it was originally built or designed for","Adaptive reuse refers to the process of reusing an existing building for a purpose other than which it was originally built or designed for. Adaptive reuse is an effective strategy for optimizing the operational and commercial performance of built assets. Adaptive reuse of buildings can be an attractive alternative to new construction in terms of sustainability and a circular economy. Not every old building can qualify for adaptive reuse. Architects developers builders and entrepreneurs who wish to become involved in rejuvenating and reconstructing a building must first make sure that the finished product will serve the need of the market that it will be completely useful for its new purpose and that it will be competitively priced. Adaptive Reuse is defined as the aesthetic process that adapts buildings for new uses while retaining their historic features. Using an adaptive reuse model can prolong a building s life from cradle to grave by retaining all or most of the building system including the structure the shell and even the interior materials. This type of revitalization is not restricted to buildings of historic significance and can be a strategy adopted in case of obsolete buildings. Some urban planners see adaptive reuse as an effective way of reducing urban sprawl and environmental impact. Revitalizing the existing built fabric by finding a new use or purpose for obsolete buildings can be a wonderful resource to a community by keeping neighborhoods occupied and vital . According to Yung and Chan adaptive reuse is a new kind of maintainable rebirth of city as it covers the building s lifetime and evades destruction waste encourages recycles of the embodied dynamism and also delivers substantial social and economic profits to the world . According to Zaitzevsky and Bunnell old buildings physically link us to our past and become a part of our cultural heritage they should be preserved because of their architectural beauty and the character and scale they add to the built environment . Retention and rehabilitation of existing buildings also reduces the consumption of building materials resources energy and water needed for new construction. Building owners architects developers and other stakeholders undergo an in depth process of decision making before determining whether a building should be conserved and remodeled for a different use or just demolished for the land it sits on then develop a new building on that land. These decisions are governed by the following criteria The decision to reuse or demolish built assets is driven by economic considerations such as development costs project costs investment returns and market. The economic costs differ from project to project and some professionals go as far as to assert that new build is always more economical and renovation is universally more expensive due to their own involvement with adaptive reuse projects. Others claim that the return on investment is enhanced when using an older building because of the savings involved. One Canadian developer claims that reusing buildings generally represents a saving of between over building new. In terms of profitability there are also assertions that adaptive reuse projects often have an uncertainty to their profitably that newer developments lack. When looking for funding to build these considerations must be addressed. In a survey conducted by Bullen and Love it was observed that building owners and operators were most concerned about a multitude of financial considerations while deciding whether to reuse their built assets. These include development and construction costs marketing and maintenance costs. According to Bullen and Love the adaptive reuse decision making was fundamentally driven by a desire for short term profits . However most of the survey respondents were rarely concerned about the sustainability and environmental concerns associated with adaptive reuse decision making. Nevertheless many of these developers were aware of the positive impact that building reuse and sustainability can have on their corporate image. Building owners are concerned with the life expectancy of built assets their energy and environmental performance and the high operating costs which may appear due to poor mechanical equipment services building materials and construction. Developers saw a thorough potential in saving groundwork and excavation costs by using an adaptive reuse model for their property. Additionally they thought that in Central Business District locations built assets are an attractive investment option for reuse projects as premium prices and rents can be obtained for an office space . Best rents can be obtained only when these remodeled buildings hold high quality finishes and have high Energy Star rating appliances. Building owners also considered the commercial performance of buildings in terms of tenant needs investment returns maintenance repair costs operational costs productivity levels employee retention rates aesthetics of building and its market value . Building stakeholders often marketed their reused built assets centered around epoch and utility and character and ambiance . Some end users were more attracted to modern architecture while others were more into the adaptive reuse style. This varying perception of a building s form function and style depended on the occupant age group. Sometimes built assets cannot be considered suitable for adaptive reuse simply because of the nature of their built form or the condition that they are in. For example one cannot make the most out of a highly compartmentalized single use building such as a prison. Mid s low rise apartments that have low floor area ratios FAR and which may be in some of the cities prime locations cannot be considered profitable for adaptive reuse. In such scenarios it would be more profitable for the developers to demolish and replace the existing building with a high rise that has more space to sell. Often when building owners cannot find an obvious use for a building it is left to degenerate and decay and eventually collapse. This may pose as a threat to the safety of the neighborhood. Decaying buildings may even be subject to vandalism and become spaces for anti social activities and may have a negative impact on the value of the properties in their vicinity. Bullen and Love s survey respondents thought that the benefits of reusing their existing facility could include avoiding the disruption of relocation reducing maintenance and running costs . A reuse project should not compromise on satisfying user needs. The survey respondents suggested that a cost vs benefits analysis is essential to determine the return on investment of an adaptive reuse project. The most important governing factors of adaptive reuse decision making with respect to asset condition were observed to be the building s structural integrity its residual service life its spatial layout its location and the ease of retrofitting or installing new building components to the existing built form. According to Bullen and Love the buildings of s and s in Perth were badly constructed used ineffective thermal insulation materials and details and have low suitability for adaptive reuse. On the other hand the built form of the s was deemed to be engineered to specifications and could accommodate an adaptive reuse model. The survey respondents expressed several concerns and risks that could arise during and after the adaptive reuse of a building which included finding tenants the threat of building not meeting the demand of the end users lack of structural stability and structure and material decay during the reconstruction phase of the project. In Bullen and Love s survey many respondents thought that there was not enough support and incentives from the government for carrying out adaptive reuse of built assets. They felt that there is limited flexibility in the building codes limited plot ratio bonuses and an overall lack of encouragement by state and local governments to implement innovative adaptive reuse designs. Suggested solutions from some survey respondents include establishing a mandate to only lease buildings that have undergone adaptive reuse with a high Energy Star rating. Some of the architects thought that there was a high dependency and credit given to energy and green building rating systems such as the Green Star Environment Rating System but not enough credit was given to the improvements carried out during adaptive reuse and its sustainable outcomes such as the recycling of building materials reduced energy and water consumption and reduced environmental impacts like global warming potential eutrophication potential and ozone layer depletion. One architect thought that undertaking exemplar adaptive reuse demonstration projects for industry professionals to assess and emulate would display a commitment to sustainability and urban regeneration . However this solution has several harmful implications and forcing an adaptive reuse directive on to the industry and its clients was deemed to be heavy handed and could be counterproductive. The existing building codes and regulations for fire safety and building access to disabled make it difficult to work around the adaptive reuse of old constructed buildings. In this civilized world buildings have become the core of a society. Cities and communities grow organically around important buildings followed by the commercial development of those neighborhoods. These buildings and the development around them soon become the heart of a community upon which people s life depends. Therefore regular maintenance and reuse of existing structures can help communities avoid the trauma caused by dilapidation abandonment and clearance. As these heritage settlements have been getting crowded in the past decades people have been looking for farther lands for development. This rapid urbanization and urban sprawl cause several harms to our planet and the society. Lack of adaptive reuse of existing built assets on a societal level has caused disturbance due to dislocation of residents economic decline and disruption of community life eventually leading to abandoned and obsolete neighborhoods. Old buildings are often found in fully developed neighborhoods where public amenities like sewers water lines roads etc. have already been established. Adaptive reuse means that the stakeholders of the built asset are relieving governments and municipalities off the load of having to supply these public amenities on distant plots. In a survey conducted by researcher Sheila Conejos several architects developers and building stakeholders were asked about their opinion on the social implications of adaptive reuse of existing buildings. It was observed that most respondents thought that adaptive reuse is important to the society because old buildings are critical to the image and history of a society. They agreed that historical buildings add to the aesthetics of a townscape and should be preserved and reused. Buildings consume high amounts of energy during their life cycle. New construction requires new building materials and other resources which possess high embodied energy throughout their extraction manufacture transportation packaging and assembly phases . Additionally they also cause high environmental damage such as global warming eutrophication ocean acidification ozone layer depletion carbon emission which in turn harms human health and quality of life. From this standpoint there are several environmental benefits associated with building recycling or adaptive reuse. Water is an important component in building construction. Water is needed at every stage of a building s life from building material extraction to manufacture on site construction processes such as concrete mixing cleaning etc. operational phase in the form of plumbing for human use and landscaping and fire safety and at the end of its life for recycling building materials or disposing them. Selecting adaptive reuse over brand new construction can help relieve the planet off such water loads. Just as water is needed in every stage of a building s life so is energy. This energy is conventionally obtained from non renewable sources and causes high carbon emission. Minimizing fossil fuel depletion and carbon emission can be huge contributing factors to reducing global warming and mitigating climate change. Choosing to demolish an existing built asset and then constructing a brand new building in its place can lead to high energy requirement for the demolition building material waste management new material procurement construction and operation. On the other hand sustainably retrofitting an existing built asset only requires a fraction of this energy. It is important to keep in mind that many of the old building may not have the best of operational energy use efficiency. Therefore to achieve a successful adaptive reuse project the designers must keep the building s energy use intensity at utmost importance. Building materials are generally procured from the Earth s strata or are end products of processed natural components. These resources are limited. Irresponsible extraction of natural compounds for building material manufacture can deplete these natural compounds from the earth. Moreover extraction can cause harm to the natural habitat and biodiversity of the region where materials are extracted. Therefore a project that uses minimum new building material and uses more of recycled materials is a more sustainable and responsible choice for a building material. According to Chusid s urban ore concept existing buildings that are fast approaching dilapidation or disuse are a mine of raw materials for new projects . Shen and Langston built upon this idea and said that an even more effective solution than raw material recovery is adaptive reuse . They studied that a huge focus on economic factors alone has led to the destruction of buildings well short of their physical lives . Shen and Langston developed an integrated model for the assessment of adaptive reuse potential by comparing case studies of one urban and one non urban setting. The basis of this model lies in that opportunity rises and falls within the confines of a negative exponential decay function linked to a building s physical life expectancy . According to their study a building reaches its maximum potential for adaptive reuse at a point when the building s age and its useful life merge or meet. At this point the building s adaptive reuse potential is either an upward curve or a downward curve which can determine whether the potential is high medium or low. The adaptive reuse potential calculator establishes a predicted useful life of a building by considering a series of physical economic functional technological social legal and political characteristics. These characteristics are used to derive an annual obsolescence rate and environmental obsolescence . These outcomes are necessary to determine an optimum point at which adaptive reuse intervention should occur. Obsolescence is advanced as a suitable concept to objectively reduce the expected physical life of a building to its expected useful life. A discounting philosophy is adopted whereby the annual obsolescence rate across all criteria is the discount rate that performs this transformation. An algorithm based on a standard decay negative exponential curve produces an index of reuse potential known as the ARP score and is expressed as a percentage. This decay curve in buildings can be used to establish an ARP score which is expressed in percentage. Cities can rank their existing buildings as per their adaptive reuse potential and this data can be used by government authorities at any point in time. An adaptive reuse score of or above is considered high. A low ARP score is anything below . Anything between that range is considered moderate. Shen and Langston devised this concept of ARP as rising from zero to its maximum score at the point of its useful life and then falling back to zero as it approaches physical life . When the current building age is identified to be close to or end of its useful life is the right time for builders to commence redesign. Buildings have a high impact on the environment the economy and our society. Adaptive reuse has several benefits to mitigate those high impacts. Adaptive reuse projects are in many ways different from conventional new construction projects and must be planned and managed differently. Before starting an adaptive reuse project and even considering refurbishment it is important that the condition of the existing building is thoroughly assessed. A condition assessment primarily inspects a building s structural integrity roofing masonry plaster wood work tiling and the mechanical electrical and plumbing systems. The in depth inspection of buildings can be expensive. Nevertheless building condition assessment is critical to the success of an adaptive reuse project and must not be avoided at any cost because this expense is insignificant relative to the injury or loss of life that a building failure might cause. One logical reason as explained by the American Society of Civil Engineers is that even a very well constructed building could undergo serious deterioration and eventually failure if proper maintenance is not performed in the operational phase of the building. For example in the year the New York City Passenger Ship Terminal went through a thorough inspection and was identified with extreme corrosion in its exterior steel columns of web loss and of flange loss . This condition posed a threat to the public safety and had to undergo immediate restriction of live load in spite of additional bracing of critical bents. Such inspections conclude with the preparation of a detailed report summarizing the findings of the investigation. The direct inspection of the structural system is required to a certain degree which is decided by the judgement of an experienced civil engineer. After identifying the stability and soundness of a building it is important to survey the neighborhood to find the potential use and function of the adaptive reuse project for that segment of the market or region that the building owners wish to attract. In many cases an adaptive reuse project might help stabilize a neighborhood which may be otherwise decaying or be at a threat of vandalism. This upward trend may create lucrative rent opportunities for building owners and dwellers of the neighborhood. This survey can be in the form of a physical inspection of the neighborhood and or a detailed study of the zoning map of that region. Pedestrian activity presence of sidewalks street lights benches and public parks and the presence of well occupied shops and buildings can tell us a lot about neighborhoods. After the neighborhood has been established to be stable and safe and free of any infringing decay the next step is to determine what amenities it has to offer in terms of roadways public transportation shopping and eating hospitals schools and libraries and so on. As discussed previously adaptive reuse projects have the potential to work in phases or parts. A major advantage of renovating an existing building is that a refurbished portion of the building becomes suitable for occupancy before completion of the whole project. This provides as a huge advantage for private developers as it keeps the cash inflow during while the rest of the project undergoes construction. Keeping in mind the conclusions from structural and architectural survey neighborhood survey and marketing survey a budget is prepared. Building owners or developers can approach any of the financing sources such as insurance companies foundations and funds savings banks building loan societies endowment funds Real Estate Investment Trusts etc. In most adaptive reuse projects it is the architect who is the leader with the imagination of how an abandoned warehouse can become an office building or an abandoned hospital a condominium. Since the architect has a deep involvement in the success of a project he must perform his work under a clearly defined contract. Under this contract the architect and the owner are under the obligation of the contract and must abide by it. Progress of design site visits and evaluation are some of the basic actions that the architect performs under this contract. There are different types of contracts ranging from a fixed fee contract percentage of construction cost contract and fee plus expenses contract. All stakeholders may collectively decide on the most suitable type of contract for the project. Before the architect and engineer begin the final designing for the building they make a thorough structural mechanical and architectural survey of the existing building. The architect and engineer may look for signs of cracking of masonry wall or the settling of basement floors or upper floors which direct them to a problem in the foundation. These signs can also be detected from window sills and cornices. Appropriate survey instruments such as plumb bobs and spirit levels are recommended for use instead of a naked eye inspection. If the problem seems too severe a test boring may reveal the cause of the problem. Additionally the building code should be examined for fireproofing requirements. Analyzing the structural strength requires expertise and is one of the most crucial in terms of occupant safety. On site inspection along with a study of existing floor plans can help engineers determine the structural stability. In some case when the building drawings may not be available engineers may have to scrape of the plaster to reveal the underlying structure. Wooden members of the structural system should be especially checked for rot or termite infestation. Iron or steel must be checked for corrosion and loose bearings or bolting. Additional future dead and live loads must be kept in mind while designing with the structural strength of the existing building. The floor system in old buildings is usually strong enough to satisfy present codes. If not additional supporting members may be necessary. The floor and ceiling height should be able to accommodate additional stairways vertical plumbing electrical and HVAC. In some cases an elevator may have to be installed. The building envelope should be examined thoroughly for cracks watertightness infiltration or leaks and mortar joints. It is important to examine these exterior walls for future fenestration and air conditioning ducts. Buildings undergoing adaptive reuse often lack modern and energy efficient MEP systems and appliances. Heating Determining the capacity of the heating plant for the new building use and occupancy. Existing heating systems involving boilers and burners and metal piping could be salvaged for recycling. Ventilation Office and commercial buildings require ventilation. Toilets and kitchens also need ventilation. The floor height must be able to accommodate fan equipment. If the existing building consists some duct work it should be tested for obstructions deterioration and air leakage. Air conditioning Air conditioning ducting and equipment can be expensive and demand a lot of ceiling space. These economical implications must be considered for the new use of the building before deciding the installation of an air conditioning system. Plumbing Old buildings used galvanized iron pipes for plumbing which may be subject to serious deterioration over the years. Proper connection to municipal sewers must be evaluated and fixed if broken. Electrical While the electrical wiring may still be intact the panel boards junction boxes and electrical feeders may not be as per the present day fire codes. Additionally the switch boards may be outdated and have to be replaced. The architect and engineers must also determine of additional transformer vaults and feeder lines are necessary. Older building roofing systems generally comprise the roof parapets and cornices. Projecting metal cornices are subject to corrosion. Parapets may be subject to cracks and degrading mortar joints. A careful examination of the top floor ceiling may reveal water leakage. The stairway requirement for a building should be derived from present day building codes for fire and safety. Strategic placement of new staircases and layout for maximum access should be done in order to maximize space utility and minimize the burden on the structural system. Redesigning the existing building for new use must accommodate energy conservation strategies. Some of the most important methods of energy conservation are reducing heating an cooling loads through building envelopes maximizing natural ventilation potential using daylighting and energy efficient lighting fixtures and so on. A building s envelope protects it from the external weather conditions. To prevent the extreme climate of the exterior from causing discomfort to occupants buildings use mechanical heating and cooling systems. If the building envelope is not designed well the heating and cooling loads on the mechanical equipment might go high. Therefore for maximum energy efficiency building envelops should be the first layer to block out external weather conditions then the load on the equipment can be minimized. The U value of walls should not be more than . when winter design temperatures are less than F. This can be achieved by using a combination of exterior wall materials to form a high resistance wall assembly. The fenestration in an external wall assembly are the biggest wasters of energy. They waste heat by conduction radiation and infiltration. This can be controlled to an extent by using multiple layered glazing systems and using low e coatings on the glass. Additionally it is important to seal the window and door systems to avoid infiltration. Similarly in hot and sunny climates it is important to shade windows to avoid heat gain due to solar radiation. An exposed roof is the greatest source of heat loss during cold months and heat gains during hot months. Therefore roof insulation becomes very crucial in extreme climate conditions. Another passive technique is to separate living spaces from roof by adding dead buffer spaces such a attics under the roof. The only floor that need be considered is the bottom floor. It may be a slab on grade or built over a crawl space. In these cases insulation should be considered. If the perimeter of a slab on grade is insulated from the weather this is all that can be hoped for. Over a cold crawl space a two in blanket under the floor will cut the heat loss by at least . A concrete floor slab can be insulated by sprayed on insulating material. Building owners and developers can take the potential advantage of adaptive reuse by taking away components from unused buildings and then repair reuse or recycle its constituent parts. Disassembly is a form of recovering target products and plays a key role to maximize the efficiency of an adaptive reuse project. This disassembly planning sequence aims to reduce the environmental impacts caused due to demolition using a rule base recursive analysis system with practical and viable solutions. As a comparatively young country adaptive reuse is not the norm in Canada where redevelopment has typically meant demolition and building anew. Calgary and Edmonton are particularly known for their pro demolition culture but they are not unique in this regard. However since the s adaptive use has gained traction. The conversion of former railway centred warehouse districts to residential and commercial uses has occurred in Edmonton Calgary Saskatoon Regina and Winnipeg. In Toronto the Distillery District a neighbourhood in the city s southeast side was entirely adapted from the old Gooderham Worts distillery. Other prominent re uses include the Candy Factory on Queen Street West and the Toy Factory in the city s Liberty Village district both designed by Quadrangle Architects a firm specializing in adaptive re use in Toronto and elsewhere. Vancouver s Yaletown an upscale neighbourhood established in the s features warehouses and other small industrial structures and spaces converted into apartments and offices for the gentrification of the area. Vancouver s Granville Island also demonstrates a successful mix of adaptive reuse as well as retention of traditional uses in the same district. Montreal s Griffintown Old Port and Lachine Canal areas all feature ex industrial areas that have been reused or will do so in the future on current plans. Other noted adaptive reuse projects in the s have included the Laurentian School of Architecture in Sudbury which is incorporating several historic buildings in the city s downtown core into its new campus similar to the downtown campus of NSCAD University in Halifax and Mill Square in Sault Ste. Marie an ongoing project to convert the derelict St. Mary s Paper mill into a mixed use cultural and tourism hub. A number of former military bases in Canada declared surplus in the s have also proven to be opportune for adaptive reuse. An example is the former CFB Cornwallis in rural Nova Scotia which was largely converted without demolitions into a business park. Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco was the first major adaptive reuse project in the United States opening in . Urban waterfronts historically used as points for industrial production and transport are now selling points for home buyers and renters. In American city neighborhoods that have seen racial and ethnic demographic changes over the last century some houses of worship have been converted for other religions and some others have been converted into residences. A large number of brick mill buildings in the Northeast United States have undergone mill conversion projects. In the United States especially in the Northeast and Midwest loft housing is one prominent result of adaptive reuse projects. Formerly industrial areas such as the Meatpacking District in New York City Callowhill in Philadelphia and SoMa in San Francisco are being transformed into residential neighborhoods through this process. This transformation is sometimes associated with gentrification. Station Square in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania is an example of a mile long former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad terminal and headquarters being converted into a retail office hotel and tourist destination. The Pratt Street Power Plant in Baltimore was converted to offices retail and restaurants. An example of adaptive reuse conversion to office space are The Hilliard Mills. The adaptive reuse of Empire Stores will transform seven abandoned coffee warehouse in Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City into office retail restaurant and a rooftop public park. Other museums adapted from old factories include MassMOCA the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art the Watermill Center in Long Island New York and The Dia Art Foundation Museum in upstate New York. In San Diego California the historic brick structure of the Western Metal Supply Co. building at th Avenue between K and L Streets was preserved and incorporated into the design of Petco Park the new baseball only ballpark of the San Diego Padres and can be prominently seen in the left field corner of that ballpark. It now houses the team s flagship gift shop luxury rental suites a restaurant and rooftop bleachers and its southeast corner serves as the ballpark s left field foul pole. Chapman University in the city of Orange California has created student housing by converting the Villa Park Orchards Association Packing House which was built in for the Santiago Orange Growers Association. The student housing complex opened in August . The project was built with the collaboration of KTGY Architecture Planning Togawa Smith Martin and AC Martin. In Australia there have been a number of adaptive reuse projects as the main cities have turned from industrial areas into areas of high value and business areas. In Sydney sites such as the old Sydney Mint have been renovated and adapted into inner city headquarters for the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales. The movement of the city from an industrial working class area into a gentrified area with high house prices has helped a number of adaptive reuse sites to exist within such an area the old Hyde Park Barracks building has also been transformed from an old jail into a museum which documents and records the history of Australia s first settlers and convicts. The industrial history of Australia has also been an influencing factor in determining the types of buildings and areas which have gone on to become adaptive reuse sites especially in the realms of private residences and community based buildings. Some such sites include Nonda Katsalidis Malthouse apartments in Richmond a conversion of a former grain silo and the South Australian site of the Balhannah Mines which was adapted into a private residence and has received awards from the Housing Industry Association and the Design Institute of Australia. In Adelaide four prominent heritage listed th Century buildings in poor repair were restored refurbished and given new roles by the South Australian Government during the Rann Government to . The Torrens Building in Victoria Square former headquarters of the Registrar General was restored and adapted to become the Australian campus for both Carnegie Mellon University and University College London. The former Adelaide Stock Exchange building was purchased restored and adapted to become the Science Exchange for the Royal Institution Australia and the Australian Science Media Centre. The Torrens Parade Ground and building were restored for use as a headquarters for veterans organisations. Nearly million was committed to restore and adapt the large Glenside Psychiatric Hospital and precinct as the new Adelaide Studios of the South Australian Film Corporation opened by Premier Rann in October . And the hectare former Mitsubishi Motors plant is being adapted to become a clean manufacturing centre and education and training hub for Flinders University and TAFE. In Europe the main forms of adaptive reuse have been around former palaces and unused residences of the different European royal families into publicly accessible galleries and museums. Many of the spaces have been restored with period finishes and display different collections of art and design. In Paris France the most famous example of adaptive reuse is the Muse du Louvre a former palace built in the late th century under Philip II and opened to the public as a museum in . Also in London England the Queen s House a former royal residence built around has become part of the National Maritime Museum and houses the museum s fine art collection. The Tate Modern also in London is another example of adaptive reuse in the European continent unlike other adaptive reuse galleries in Europe the Tate Modern takes full advantage of the site of the former Bankside Power Station which involved the refurbishment of the old abandoned power station. The wide industrial space has proven to be a worthy backdrop to modern art with the famous turbine hall hosting artists including Olafur Eliasson Rachel Whiteread and Ai Weiwei. Other famous adaptive reuse sites in Europe include the Maastricht branch of the Selexyz chain in the Netherlands. This project received Lensvelt de Architect interior design award for its innovative reuse and is number one on The Guardian s worldwide top ten bookstores list. In d Poland the Izrael Pozna ski mills have been turned into the hectare acre Manufaktura mixed use development including a mall museums multi cinema and restaurants.

"102",102,"bioplastic","/wiki/Bioplastic",TRUE,0,"waste|","Bioplastics are plastics derived from renewable biomass sources such as vegetable fats and oils corn starch straw woodchips food waste etc","Bioplastics are plastics derived from renewable biomass sources such as vegetable fats and oils corn starch straw woodchips food waste etc. Bioplastic can be made from agricultural by products and also from used plastic bottles and other containers using microorganisms. Common plastics such as fossil fuel plastics also called petrobased polymers are derived from petroleum or natural gas. Not all bioplastics are biodegradable nor biodegrade more readily than commodity fossil fuel derived plastics. Bioplastics are usually derived from sugar derivatives including starch cellulose and lactic acid. As of bioplastics represented approximately . of the global polymer market million tons . Bioplastics are used for disposable items such as packaging crockery cutlery pots bowls and straws. Few commercial applications exist for bioplastics. In principle they could replace many applications for petroleum derived plastics however cost and performance remain problematic. As a matter of fact their usage is financially favourable only if supported by specific regulations limiting the usage of conventional plastics citation needed . Typical is the example of Italy where biodegradable plastic bags and shoppers are compulsory since with the introduction of a specific law. Beyond structural materials electroactive bioplastics are being developed that promise to be used to carry electric current. Biopolymers are available as coatings for paper rather than the more common petrochemical coatings. Thermoplastic starch currently represents the most widely used bioplastic constituting about percent of the bioplastics market citation needed . Simple starch bioplastic can be made at home. Pure starch is able to absorb humidity and is thus a suitable material for the production of drug capsules by the pharmaceutical sector. Flexibiliser and plasticiser such as sorbitol and glycerine can also be added so the starch can also be processed thermo plastically. The characteristics of the resulting bioplastic also called thermo plastical starch can be tailored to specific needs by adjusting the amounts of these additives. Starch based bioplastics are often blended with biodegradable polyesters to produce starch polylactic acid starch polycaprolactone or starch Ecoflex polybutylene adipate co terephthalate produced by BASF . blends. These blends are used for industrial applications and are also compostable. Other producers such as Roquette have developed other starch polyolefin blends. These blends are not biodegradable but have a lower carbon footprint than petroleum based plastics used for the same applications. Due to the origin of its raw material starch is cheap abundant and renewable. Starch based plastics are complex blends of starch with compostable plastics such as Polylactic acid Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate Polybutylene Succinate Polycaprolactone and Polyhydroxyalkanoates. These complex blends improve water resistance as well as processing and mechanical properties. Starch based films mostly used for packaging purposes are made mainly from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters to form biodegradable and compostable products. These films are seen specifically in consumer goods packaging of magazine wrappings and bubble films. In food packaging these films are seen as bakery or fruit and vegetable bags. Composting bags with this films are used in selective collecting of organic waste. Further a new starch based film was developed by Agricultural Research Service scientists can even be used as a paper. Cellulose bioplastics are mainly the cellulose esters including cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose and their derivatives including celluloid. Cellulose can become thermoplastic when extensively modified. An example of this is cellulose acetate which is expensive and therefore rarely used for packaging. However cellulosic fibers added to starches can improve mechanical properties permeability to gas and water resistance due to being less hydrophilic than starch. A group at Shanghai University was able to construct a novel green plastic based on cellulose through a method called hot pressing. Bioplastics can be made from proteins from different sources. For example wheat gluten and casein show promising properties as a raw material for different biodegradable polymers. Additionally soy protein is being considered as another source of bioplastic. Soy proteins have been used in plastic production for over one hundred years. For example body panels of an original Ford automobile were made of soy based plastic. There are difficulties with using soy protein based plastics due to their water sensitivity and relatively high cost. Therefore producing blends of soy protein with some already available biodegradable polyesters improves the water sensitivity and cost. The aliphatic biopolyesters are mainly polyhydroxyalkanoates PHAs like the poly hydroxybutyrate PHB polyhydroxyvalerate PHV and polyhydroxyhexanoate PHH . Polylactic acid PLA is a transparent plastic produced from corn or dextrose. Superficially it is similar to conventional petrochemical based mass plastics like PS. It has the distinct advantage of degrading to nontoxic products. Unfortunately it exhibits inferior impact strength thermal robustness and barrier properties blocking air transport across the membrane . PLA and PLA blends generally come in the form of granulates with various properties and are used in the plastic processing industry for the production of films fibers plastic containers cups and bottles. PLA is also the most common type of plastic filament used for home fused deposition modeling. The biopolymer poly hydroxybutyrate PHB is a polyester produced by certain bacteria processing glucose corn starch or wastewater. Its characteristics are similar to those of the petroplastic polypropylene. PHB production is increasing. The South American sugar industry for example has decided to expand PHB production to an industrial scale. PHB is distinguished primarily by its physical characteristics. It can be processed into a transparent film with a melting point higher than degrees Celsius and is biodegradable without residue. Polyhydroxyalkanoates are linear polyesters produced in nature by bacterial fermentation of sugar or lipids. They are produced by the bacteria to store carbon and energy. In industrial production the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions for the fermentation of sugar. More than different monomers can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties. PHA is more ductile and less elastic than other plastics and it is also biodegradable. These plastics are being widely used in the medical industry. PA is a biopolymer derived from natural oil. It is also known under the tradename Rilsan B commercialized by Arkema. PA belongs to the technical polymers family and is not biodegradable. Its properties are similar to those of PA although emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption of nonrenewable resources are reduced during its production. Its thermal resistance is also superior to that of PA . It is used in high performance applications like automotive fuel lines pneumatic airbrake tubing electrical cable antitermite sheathing flexible oil and gas pipes control fluid umbilicals sports shoes electronic device components and catheters. A similar plastic is Polyamide PA derived from castor oil under the trade name EcoPaXX commercialized by DSM. PA is a high performance polyamide that combines the benefits of a high melting point approx. C low moisture absorption and excellent resistance to various chemical substances. The basic building block monomer of polyethylene is ethylene. Ethylene is chemically similar to and can be derived from ethanol which can be produced by fermentation of agricultural feedstocks such as sugar cane or corn. Bio derived polyethylene is chemically and physically identical to traditional polyethylene it does not biodegrade but can be recycled. The Brazilian chemicals group Braskem claims that using its method of producing polyethylene from sugar cane ethanol captures removes from the environment . tonnes of CO per tonne of Green Polyethylene produced. With GM corn being a common feedstock it is unsurprising that some bioplastics are made from this. Under the bioplastics manufacturing technologies there is the plant factory model which uses genetically modified crops or genetically modified bacteria to optimise efficiency. Recently there have been a large emphasis on producing biobased and isocyanate free polyurethanes. One such example utilizes a spontaneous reaction between polyamines and cyclic carbonates to produce polyhydroxurethanes. Unlike traditional cross linked polyurethanes cross linked polyhydroxyurethanes have been shown to be capable of recycling and reprocessing through dynamic transcarbamoylation reactions. A number bioplastic classes have been synthesized from plant and animal derived fats and oils. Polyurethanes polyesters epoxy resins and a number of other types of polymers have been developed with comparable properties to crude oil based materials. The recent development of olefin metathesis has opened a wide variety of feedstocks to economical conversion into biomonomers and polymers. With the growing production of traditional vegetable oils as well as low cost microalgae derived oils there is huge potential for growth in this area. Materials such as starch cellulose wood sugar and biomass are used as a substitute for fossil fuel resources to produce bioplastics this makes the production of bioplastics a more sustainable activity compared to conventional plastic production. The environmental impact of bioplastics is often debated as there are many different metrics for greenness e.g. water use energy use deforestation biodegradation etc. . Hence bioplastic environmental impacts are categorized into nonrenewable energy use climate change eutrophication and acidification. Bioplastic production significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and decreases non renewable energy consumption. Firms worldwide would also be able to increase the environmental sustainability of their products by using bioplastics Although bioplastics save more nonrenewable energy than conventional plastics and emit less GHG compared to conventional plastics bioplastics also have negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication and acidification. Bioplastics induce higher eutrophication potentials than conventional plastics. Biomass production during industrial farming practices causes nitrate and phosphate to filtrate into water bodies this causes eutrophication which is the richness of the nutrients in body waters. Eutrophication is a threat to water resources around the world since it kills aquatic organisms creates dead zones and causes harmful algal blooms. Bioplastics also increase acidification. The high increase in eutrophication and acidification caused by bioplastics is also caused by using chemical fertilizer in the cultivation of renewable raw materials to produce bioplastics. Other environmental impacts of bioplastics include exerting lower human and terrestrial ecotoxicity and carcinogenic potentials compared to conventional plastics. However bioplastics exert higher aquatic ecotoxicity than conventional materials. Bioplastics and other bio based materials increase stratospheric ozone depletion compared to conventional plastics this is a result of nitrous oxide emissions during fertilizer application during industrial farming for biomass production. Artificial fertilizer increase nitrous oxide emissions especially when the crop does not need all the nitrogen. Minor environmental impacts of bioplastics include toxicity through using pesticides on the crops used to make bioplastics. Bioplastics also cause carbon dioxide emissions from harvesting vehicles. Other minor environmental impacts include high water consumption for biomass cultivation soil erosion soil carbon losses and loss of biodiversity and they are mainly are a result of land use associated with bioplastics. Land use for bioplastics production leads to lost carbon sequestration and increases the carbon costs while diverting land from its existing uses Although bioplastics are extremely advantageous because they reduce non renewable consumption and GHG emissions they also negatively affect the environment through land and water consumption using pesticide and fertilizer eutrophication and acidification hence one s preference for either bioplastics or conventional plastics depends on what one considers the most important environmental impact. Another issue with bioplastics is that some bioplastics are made from the edible parts of crops. This makes the bioplastics compete with food production because the crops that produce bioplastics can also be used to feed people. These bioplastics are called st generation feedstock bioplastics . nd generation feedstock bioplastics use non food crops cellulosic feedstock or waste materials from st generation feedstock e.g. waste vegetable oil . rd generation feedstock bioplastics use algae as the feedstock. Biodegradation of any plastic is a process that happens at solid liquid interface whereby the enzymes in the liquid phase depolymerize the solid phase Both bioplastics and conventional plastics containing additives are able to biodegrade. Bioplastics are able to biodegrade in different environments hence they are more acceptable than conventional plastics. Biodegradability of bioplastics occurs under various environmental conditions including soil aquatic environments and compost. Both the structure and composition of biopolymer or bio composite have an effect on the biodegradation process hence changing the composition and structure might increase biodegradability. Soil and compost as environment conditions are more efficient in biodegradation due to their high microbial diversity. Composting not only biodegrades bioplastics efficiently but it also significantly reduces the emission of greenhouse gases. Biodegradability of bioplastics in compost environments can be upgraded by adding more soluble sugar and increasing temperature. Soil environments on the other hand have high diversity of microorganisms making it easier for biodegradation of bioplastics to occur. However bioplastics in soil environments need higher temperatures and a longer time to biodegrade. Some bioplastics biodegrade more efficiently in water bodies and marine systems however this causes danger to marine ecosystems and freshwater. Hence it is accurate to conclude that biodegradation of bioplastics in water bodies which leads to the death of aquatic organisms and unhealthy water can be noted as one of the negative environmental impacts of bioplastics. While plastics based on organic materials were manufactured by chemical companies throughout the th century the first company solely focused on bioplastics Marlborough Biopolymers was founded in . However Marlborough and other ventures that followed failed to find commercial success with the first such company to secure long term financial success being the Italian company Novamont founded in . The expense and time requirements of researching and testing new bio based and biodegradable polymers have placed bioplastics at a commercial disadvantage compared to petrochemical based plastics. Bioplastics remain less than one percent of all plastics manufactured worldwide and until very recently have been an average of times more expensive to manufacture than petrochemical plastics. Most bioplastics do not yet save more carbon emissions than are required to manufacture them. In addition to the cost of research bioplastics lack the versatility of application that petrochemical plastics possess with many conventional plastics having no bio based equivalent that can match their quality. Finally the industry faces logistical problems with both material sources and waste disposal infrastructure. As most bioplastics are produced from plant sugars starches or oils it is estimated that replacing million tons of the plastic manufactured each year with bio based plastics would require million hectares of land or percent of the arable land on Earth. And when bioplastics reach the end of their life cycle those designed to be compostable and marketed as biodegradable are often sent to landfills due to the lack of proper composting facilities or waste sorting where they then release methane as they break down anaerobically. Despite this the bioplastics industry has grown by a year. BCC Research forecast that the global market for biodegradable polymers would grow at a compound average growth rate of more than percent through and this rate of growth has actually been exceeded. Bio based plastics are predicted to make up of all manufactured plastics in and of all manufactured plastics in . Ceresana predicts that when bioplastics reach of the plastics market in the market for bio based plastics will be worth . billion dollars three times the size of the bioplastics market in . The largest demand for bioplastics has been in packaging driven by widespread concern over the use of petrochemical plastics in disposable one use products that are then sequestered in landfills or the natural environment. Packaging continues to provide of the market for bioplastic and to account for the largest share of growth in the industry. There has been a shift in the market for an increased demand of bioplastics especially for sustainable packaging. This has been seen specifically in Western Europe which accounted for more than of the global biodegradable plastics demand in . This demand from consumers for more sustainable options was also seen in recent policies Italy has banned the use of petroleum based plastic bags and there is a tax on use of petroleum based plastic bags in Germany However the industry in biobased polymers has not grown as rapidly as some have predicted. The NNFCC predicted that the industry would exceed . million tonnes produced each year by but by in only . million tonnes of bioplastic were produced in that year. This remains only a small fraction of all plastics manufacturing which produced a total million tonnes of thermoplastics in . As production expands there remain no universal standards governing bioplastics and their manufacture or disposal. This includes a lack of any regulation on the amount of sustainably sourced material in a product required for it to be marketed as a bioplastic. It should also be noted that according to Market and Market the global biodegradable plastics market is just beginning and only accounts for less than of the overall plastics market Because of the fragmentation in the market and ambiguous definitions it is difficult to describe the total market size for bioplastics but estimates put global production capacity at tonnes. In contrast global production of polyethylene PE and polypropylene PP the world s leading petrochemical derived polyolefins was estimated at over million tonnes in . COPA Committee of Agricultural Organisation in the European Union and COGEGA General Committee for the Agricultural Cooperation in the European Union have made an assessment of the potential of bioplastics in different sectors of the European economy not a comprehensive list inventions pulled by the author to show versatility of bioplastics and important breakthroughs new applications and inventions of bioplastics happen each year The EN industrial standard is arguably the most international in scope. This standard must be met in order to claim that a plastic product is compostable in the European marketplace. In summary it requires biodegradation of of the materials in a lab within days. The ASTM standard is the regulatory framework for the United States and sets a less stringent threshold of biodegradation within days for non homopolymers and biodegradation of homopolymers within industrial composting conditions temperatures at or above F . Municipal compost facilities do not see above F. citation needed Many starch based plastics PLA based plastics and certain aliphatic aromatic co polyester compounds such as succinates and adipates have obtained these certificates. Additive based bioplastics sold as photodegradable or Oxo Biodegradable do not comply with these standards in their current form. The ASTM D method for determining the compostability of a plastic defined the word compostable as follows that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide water inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials. This definition drew much criticism because contrary to the way the word is traditionally defined it completely divorces the process of composting from the necessity of it leading to humus compost as the end product. The only criterion this standard does describe is that a compostable plastic must look to be going away as fast as something else one has already established to be compostable under the traditional definition. In January the ASTM withdrew standard ASTM D which had provided plastic manufacturers with the legal credibility to label a plastic as compostable. Its description is as follows This guide covered suggested criteria procedures and a general approach to establish the compostability of environmentally degradable plastics. The ASTM has yet to replace this standard. The ASTM D method has been developed to certify the biologically derived content of bioplastics. Cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere mean that some of the carbon is the radioactive isotope carbon . CO from the atmosphere is used by plants in photosynthesis so new plant material will contain both carbon and carbon . Under the right conditions and over geological timescales the remains of living organisms can be transformed into fossil fuels. After years all the carbon present in the original organic material will have undergone radioactive decay leaving only carbon . A product made from biomass will have a relatively high level of carbon while a product made from petrochemicals will have no carbon . The percentage of renewable carbon in a material solid or liquid can be measured with an accelerator mass spectrometer. There is an important difference between biodegradability and biobased content. A bioplastic such as high density polyethylene HDPE can be biobased i.e. contain renewable carbon yet be non biodegradable. These bioplastics such as HDPE nonetheless play an important role in greenhouse gas abatement particularly when they are combusted for energy production. The biobased component of these bioplastics is considered carbon neutral since their origin is from biomass. The ASTM D and ASTM D are testing methods that comply with international standards such as the ISO DIS for the biodegradability of plastic.",FALSE

It requires the repair or replacement of worn out or obsolete components and modules. Parts subject to degradation affecting the performance or the expected life of the whole are replaced. Remanufacturing is a form of a product recovery process that differs from other recovery processes in its completeness a remanufactured machine should match the same customer expectation as new machines. In the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA implemented the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline CPG program to promote waste reduction and resource conservation through the use of materials recovered from solid waste and to ensure that the materials collected in recycling programs will be used again in the manufacture of new products. The EPA is required to designate products that are or can be made with recovered materials and to recommend practices for buying these products. Once a product is designated state and federal procuring agencies are required to purchase it with the highest recovered material content level practicable. In the EPA published its third CPG update CPG IV which designated seven additional products and revised three existing product designations. One of the new product categories to be added was Rebuilt Vehicular Parts. The EPA defines rebuilt vehicular parts as vehicle parts that have been re manufactured reusing parts in their original form. Rebuilt parts undergo an extensive re manufacturing and testing process and must meet the same industry specifications for performance as new parts. In the UK a market potential of up to . billion GBP has been identified in remanufacturing with the benefits said to be improvement to business margins revenues and security of supply. Many formal definitions of remanufacturing exist in the literature but the first published report on remanufacturing by R. Lund describes remanufacturing as ... an industrial process in which worn out products are restored to like new condition. Through a series of industrial processes in a factory environment a discarded product is completely disassembled. Useable parts are cleaned refurbished and put into inventory. Then the product is reassembled from the old parts and where necessary new parts to produce a unit fully equivalent and sometimes superior in performance and expected lifetime to the original new product . Furthermore the Automotive Parts Remanufacturers Association APRA realized that communication problems can arise when people from different countries with different language skills talk about remanufacturing. Certain terms can have different meanings as definitions between countries and individuals vary. In APRA was able to solve these communication problems by publishing a common translation list in many different languages in order to unite all those who deal with the automotive industry. There are three main types of remanufacturing activities each with different operational challenges. Remanufacturing by Recoating of Worn Engine Parts In addition to these is a less significant type of remanufacturing remanufacturing by recoating of worn engine parts. This type of remanufacturing serves many engine parts and other large and expensive components that become worn after a period of use. An example of such a part is the engine block in particular the cylinder engine bores which must withstand explosions during piston firing. Instead of disposing of large engine blocks remanufacturing has resulted in re use of the parts by coating them with plasma transferred wire arc spraying PTWA . Remanufacturing by recoating of parts is also very popular in the aircraft field the geothermal pipe field and the automotive engine field. Rebuilding is an old name for remanufacturing. It is still widely used by automotive industry. For example the Automotive Parts Remanufacturers Association APRA have the new term in their name but to be safe on their own website use the combined term rebuild remanufacture . The term rebuilding is also often used by railway companies a steam locomotive may be rebuilt with a new boiler or a diesel locomotive may be rebuilt with a new engine. This saves money by re using the frame and some other components which still have years of useful life and allows the incorporation of improved technology. For example a new diesel engine may have lower fuel consumption reduced exhaust emissions and better reliability. Recent examples include British Rail Class and British Rail Class .",FALSE

Repurposing is as old as human civilization with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways. More recently repurposing has been celebrated by st century hobbyists and arts and crafts organizations such as Instructables and other Maker culture communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the st century. Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left and right libertarianism. Repurposing is the use of a tool being re channeled into being another tool usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool maker. Typically repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk garbage or obsolete. A good example of this would be the Earthship style of house that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose. Examples of repurposing include using tires as boat fenders and steel drums or plastic drums as feeding troughs and or composting bins. Incinerator and power plant exhaust stack fly ash is used extensively as an additive to concrete providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes for example using worn out clothes as rags. Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly in which repurposing vehicles for electric car conversion can be the recommended alternative to that though its cost can be negligible upfront.",FALSE
"105",105,"hazardous waste","/wiki/Hazardous_waste",TRUE,0,"waste|","Hazardous waste is waste that has substantial or potential threats to public health or the environment","Hazardous waste is waste that has substantial or potential threats to public health or the environment. Hazardous wastes may be found in different physical states such as gaseous liquids or solids. A hazardous waste is a special type of waste because it cannot be disposed of by common means like other by products of our everyday lives. Depending on the physical state of the waste treatment and solidification processes might be required. Worldwide the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP estimated that more than million tons of hazardous wastes are produced universally each year mostly by industrialized countries schmit . About percent of this is shipped across international boundaries with the majority of the transfers occurring between countries in the Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Krueger . One of the reasons for industrialized countries to ship the hazardous waste to industrializing countries for disposal is the rising cost of disposing of hazardous waste in the home country. Hazardous wastes are wastes with properties that make them dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous wastes can be liquids solids contained gases or sludges. They can be by products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms RCRA hazardous wastes are wastes that appear on one of the four hazardous wastes lists F list K list P list or U list or exhibit at least one of the following four characteristics ignitability corrosivity reactivity or toxicity. in the US Hazardous wastes are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA Subtitle C . By definition EPA determined that some specific wastes are hazardous. These wastes are incorporated into lists published by the Agency. These lists are organized into three categories F list non specific source wastes found in the regulations at CFR . K list source specific wastes found in the regulations at CFR . and P list and the U list discarded commercial chemical products found in the regulations at CFR .. RCRA s record keeping system helps to track the life cycle of hazardous waste and reduces the amount of hazardous waste illegally disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA was enacted in . The primary contribution of CERCLA was to create a Superfund and provide for the clean up and remediation of closed and abandoned hazardous waste sites. CERCLA addresses historic releases of hazardous materials but does not specifically manage hazardous wastes. In the United States the treatment storage and disposal of hazardous waste are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA . Hazardous wastes are defined under RCRA in CFR where they are divided into two major categories characteristic wastes and listed wastes. The requirements of the RCRA apply to all the companies that generate hazardous waste as well as those companies that store or dispose hazardous waste in the United States. Many types of businesses generate hazardous waste. dry cleaners automobile repair shops hospitals exterminators and photo processing centers may all generate hazardous waste. Some hazardous waste generators are larger companies such as chemical manufacturers electroplating companies and oil refineries. A U.S. facility that treats stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a permit for doing so under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Generators and transporters of hazardous waste must meet specific requirements for handling managing and tracking waste. Through the RCRA Congress directed the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA to create regulations to manage hazardous waste. Under this mandate the EPA developed strict requirements for all aspects of hazardous waste management including the treatment storage and disposal of hazardous waste. In addition to these federal requirements states may develop more stringent requirements that are broader in scope than the federal regulations. Furthermore RCRA allows states to develop regulatory programs that are at least as stringent as RCRA and after review by EPA the states may take over responsibility for the implementation of the requirements under RCRA. Most states take advantage of this authority implementing their own hazardous waste programs that are at least as stringent and in some cases are more stringent than the federal program. The U.S. government provides several tools for mapping hazardous wastes to particular locations. These tools also allow the user to view additional information. Universal wastes are a special category of hazardous wastes that in the U.S. Some of the most common universal wastes are fluorescent light bulbs some specialty batteries e.g. lithium or lead containing batteries cathode ray tubes and mercury containing devices. Universal wastes are subject to somewhat less stringent regulatory requirements. Small quantity generators of universal wastes may be classified as conditionally exempt small quantity generators CESQGs which release them from some of the regulatory requirements for the handling and storage hazardous wastes. Universal wastes must still be disposed of properly. For more information see Overview of Requirements for Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators Household Hazardous Waste HHW also referred to as domestic hazardous waste or home generated special materials is a waste that is generated from residential households. HHW only applies to waste coming from the use of materials that are labeled for and sold for home use . Waste generated by a company or at an industrial setting is not HHW. The following list includes categories often applied to HHW. It is important to note that many of these categories overlap and that many household wastes can fall into multiple categories Historically some hazardous wastes were disposed of in regular landfills. This resulted in unfavorable amounts of hazardous materials seeping into the ground. These chemicals eventually entered to natural hydrologic systems. Many landfills now require countermeasures against groundwater contamination. For example a barrier has to be installed along the foundation of the landfill to contain the hazardous substances that may remain in the disposed waste. Currently hazardous wastes must often be stabilized and solidified in order to enter a landfill and must undergo different treatments in order to stabilize and dispose of them. Most flammable materials can be recycled into industrial fuel. Some materials with hazardous constituents can be recycled such as lead acid batteries. Some hazardous wastes can be recycled into new products. Examples may include lead acid batteries or electronic circuit boards. When heavy metals in these types of ashes go through the proper treatment they could bind to other pollutants and convert them into easier to dispose solids or they could be used as pavement filling. Such treatments reduce the level of threat of harmful chemicals like fly and bottom ash citation needed while also recycling the safe product. There is a recycling center facility in Oxnard CA. The city does not charge for any hazardous materials being disposed of but there is a limit to how much you can bring per month. Other than hazardous waste the city also allows you to dispose of electronic waste light bulbs and batteries. Another commonly used treatment is cement based solidification and stabilization. Cement is used because it can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. The cement produced is categorized into different divisions depending on its strength and components. This process of converting sludge into cement might include the addition of pH adjustment agents phosphates or sulfur reagents to reduce the settling or curing time increase the compressive strength or reduce the leach ability of contaminants. Hazardous waste may be destroyed . For example by incinerating them at a high temperature flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. For example many cement kilns burn hazardous wastes like used oils or solvents. Today incineration treatments not only reduce the amount of hazardous waste but also generate energy from the gases released in the process. It is known that this particular waste treatment releases toxic gases produced by the combustion of byproduct or other materials which can affect the environment. However current technology has developed more efficient incinerator units that control these emissions to a point where this treatment is considered a more beneficial option. There are different types of incinerators which vary depending on the characteristics of the waste. Starved air incineration is another method used to treat hazardous wastes. Just like in common incineration burning occurs however controlling the amount of oxygen allowed proves to be significant to reduce the amount of harmful byproducts produced. Starved air incineration is an improvement of the traditional incinerators in terms of air pollution. Using this technology it is possible to control the combustion rate of the waste and therefore reduce the air pollutants produced in the process. Hazardous waste may be sequestered in an hazardous waste landfill or permanent disposal facility. In terms of hazardous waste a landfill is defined as a disposal facility or part of a facility where hazardous waste is placed or on land and which is not a pile a land treatment facility a surface impoundment an underground injection well a salt dome formation a salt bed formation an underground mine a cave or a corrective action management unit CFR . . Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using pyrolysis in an ultra high temperature electrical arc in inert conditions to avoid combustion. This treatment method may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types including PCBs pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants.",FALSE
"106",106,"Sustainable transport","/wiki/Sustainable_transport",TRUE,0,"broad|subject|sustainable|","Sustainable transport refers to the broad subject of transport that is sustainable in the senses of social environmental and climate impacts","Sustainable transport refers to the broad subject of transport that is sustainable in the senses of social environmental and climate impacts. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road water or air transport the source of energy and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport roads railways airways waterways canals and terminals . Transport operations and logistics as well as transit oriented development are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system. Short term activity often promotes incremental improvement in fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions controls while long term goals include migrating transportation from fossil based energy to other alternatives such as renewable energy and use of other renewable resources. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to sustainability measurement and optimization. Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental social and economic sustainability of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased mobility with poor households benefiting greatly from low carbon transport options. The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental social and economic costs that transport systems pose. Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment accounting for between and of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The majority of the emissions almost came from direct burning of fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector. Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog. The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP estimates that each year . million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided. Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon a component of particulate matter which is a known cause of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change. The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change and by improving public health through better air quality. The social costs of transport include road crashes air pollution physical inactivity time taken away from the family while commuting and vulnerability to fuel price increases. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. Traffic congestion imposes economic costs by wasting people s time and by slowing the delivery of goods and services. Traditional transport planning aims to improve mobility especially for vehicles and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access to work education goods and services friends and family and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts and managing traffic congestion. Communities which are successfully improving the sustainability of their transport networks are doing so as part of a wider programme of creating more vibrant livable sustainable cities. The term sustainable transport came into use as a logical follow on from sustainable development and is used to describe modes of transport and systems of transport planning which are consistent with wider concerns of sustainability. There are many definitions of the sustainable transport and of the related terms sustainable transportation and sustainable mobility. One such definition from the European Union Council of Ministers of Transport defines a sustainable transportation system as one that Sustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A life cycle assessment involves production use and post use considerations. A cradle to cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency. Most of the tools and concepts of sustainable transport were developed before the phrase was coined. Walking the first mode of transport is also the most sustainable. Public transport dates back at least as far as the invention of the public bus by Blaise Pascal in . The first passenger tram began operation in and the first passenger rail service in . Pedal bicycles date from the s. These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to World War II and remain the only options for most people in the developing world. Freight was moved by human power animal power or rail. The post war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between and with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better designed roads and motorways which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of Urban Planning and identified induced demand as a pivotal change from predict and provide toward a sustainable approach incorporating land use planning and public transit. Public investment in transit walking and cycling declined dramatically in the United States Great Britain and Australia although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe. Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the oil crisis and the energy crisis. The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel. Transport innovations dating from this period include high occupancy vehicle lanes citywide carpool systems and transportation demand management. Singapore implemented congestion pricing in the late s and Curitiba began implementing its Bus Rapid Transit system in the early s. Relatively low and stable oil prices during the s and s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing distant from shops and from workplaces now referred to as urban sprawl. Trends in freight logistics including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for just in time deliveries meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic. At the same time the academic foundations of the predict and provide approach to transport were being questioned notably by Peter Newman in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid s. The British Government s White Paper on Transport marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK. In the introduction to the White Paper Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible and would not work. A companion document to the White Paper called Smarter Choices researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over . A similar study by the United States Federal Highway Administration was also released in and also concluded that a more proactive approach to transportation demand was an important component of overall national transport strategy. Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases responsible for of world energy related GHG emissions in with about three quarters coming from road vehicles. Currently of transport energy comes from petroleum. Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles and is embodied in transport infrastructure including roads bridges and railways. The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to Theodore Von Karman. After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced an model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis. Chester and Orwath have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure. The environmental impacts of transport can be reduced by reducing the weight of vehicles sustainable styles of driving reducing the friction of tires encouraging electric and hybrid vehicles improving the walking and cycling environment in cities and by enhancing the role of public transport especially electric rail. Green vehicles are intended to have less environmental impact than equivalent standard vehicles although when the environmental impact of a vehicle is assessed over the whole of its life cycle this may not be the case. Electric vehicle technology has the potential to reduce transport CO emissions depending on the embodied energy of the vehicle and the source of the electricity. The primary sources of electricity currently used in most countries coal gas oil mean that until world electricity production changes substantially private electric cars will result in the same or higher production of CO than petrol equivalent vehicles. The Online Electric Vehicle OLEV developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology KAIST is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a km roundtrip along which the bus will receive kW horsepower electricity at an maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface. At that power only a few sections of the road need embedded cables. Hybrid vehicles which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine are already common. Natural gas is also used as a transport fuel. Biofuels are a less common and less promising technology Brazil met of its transport fuel needs from bioethanol in but the OECD has warned that the success of biofuels in Brazil is due to specific local circumstances internationally biofuels are forecast to have little or no impact on greenhouse emissions at significantly higher cost than energy efficiency measures. In practice there is a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more fuel efficient but only in comparison with standard vehicles and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well patronised public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles. Green public transport vehicles including electric trains trams and electric buses combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human powered vehicles and animal powered transport. The most common green transport choice with the least environmental impact is walking. Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency see fuel efficiency in transportation . Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences linked to radical drops in public transport walking and cycling. In many cases streets became void of life. Stores schools government centers and libraries moved away from central cities and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic the number of cars on US roads between and a.m. increases during the school year. Yet another impact was an increase in sedentary lifestyles causing and complicating a national epidemic of obesity and accompanying dramatically increased health care costs. Cities are shaped by their transport systems. In The City in History Lewis Mumford documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center often located near a port or waterway and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or later by rail or tram lines. In the New York World s Fair included a model of an imagined city built around a car based transport system. In this greater and better world of tomorrow residential commercial and industrial areas were separated and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways. These ideas captured the popular imagination and are credited with influencing city planning from the s to the s. The popularity of the car in the post war era led to major changes in the structure and function of cities. There was some opposition to these changes at the time. The writings of Jane Jacobs in particular The Death and Life of Great American Cities provide a poignant reminder of what was lost in this transformation and a record of community efforts to resist these changes. Lewis Mumford asked is the city for cars or for people Donald Appleyard documented the consequences for communities of increasing car traffic in The View from the Road and in the UK Mayer Hillman first published research into the impacts of traffic on child independent mobility in . Despite these notes of caution trends in car ownership car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post war period. Mainstream transport planning in Europe has by contrast never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example the Dutch Transport Structure Scheme has since the s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met if the contribution to societal welfare is positive and since has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic. Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to land use planning notably Curitiba Brazil Portland Oregon and Vancouver Canada. There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities an average U.S. urban dweller uses times more energy annually for private transport than a Chinese urban resident and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking cycling and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design. The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable as measured by per capita fossil fuel use. The social and economic sustainability of car based transportation engineering has also been questioned. Within the United States residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips but travel shorter distances and walk cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing which is becoming popular in North America and Europe and according to The Economist carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like Zoom in India eHi in China and Carrot in Mexico are bringing car sharing to developing countries in an effort to reduce car related pollution ameliorate traffic and expand the number of people who have access to cars. The European Commission adopted the Action Plan on urban mobility on for sustainable urban mobility. The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year and will assess the need for further action. In of the European population lived in urban areas which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around of the EU s GDP is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental CO air pollution noise and competitiveness congestion terms while at the same time addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to health problems and demographic trends fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of persons with reduced mobility families and children. Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level. Outside Western Europe cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include Curitiba Brazil Bogota Colombia Portland Oregon and Vancouver Canada. The state of Victoria Australia passed legislation in the Transport Integration Act to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy planning and operations. Many other cities throughout the world have recognised the need to link sustainability and transport policies for example by joining the Cities for Climate Protection program. Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement albeit one which is now recognised as of citywide national and international significance. Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations including the fast growing population of older citizens. Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own or cannot drive cars and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden. An organization called Greenxc started in created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to carpool by ride sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage posts and photography. Ride sharing reduces individual s carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars. Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century but trends since have been more complex. Oil price rises from have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the US Britain and Australia. In global oil consumption fell by . overall with significant declines in consumption in North America Western Europe and parts of Asia. Other factors affecting a decline in driving at least in America include the retirement of Baby Boomers who now drive less preference for other travel modes such as transit by younger age cohorts the Great Recession and the rising use of technology internet mobile devices which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive. Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport. The European Cyclists Federation which focuses on daily cycling for transport has created a document containing a non complete overview. In the UK employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives. The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased. You can also get other support. The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine. The employer can expect a tax deduction lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars. Since there has been a scheme in Iceland Samgngugreislur where those who do not drive a car to work get paid a lump of money monthly. An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week or of the days for a period. Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust. Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles period tickets for public transport and the like. Since amounts up to ISK per month have been tax free. Most major workplaces offer this and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme. From the year half the amount is tax free if the employee sings a contract not to use a car to work for more than of the days of the contract period. The term green transport is often used as a greenwash marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance Norway s consumer ombudsman has targeted automakers who claim that their cars are green clean or environmentally friendly . Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC describes green claims on products as very vague inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim which risks misleading them. In the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of Saab cars which was found by the Australian Federal Court as misleading. The EU Directorate General for Transport and Energy DG TREN has launched a programme which focusses mostly on Urban Transport. Its main measures are",FALSE
